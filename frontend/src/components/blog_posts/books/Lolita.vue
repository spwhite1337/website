    <h2>Lolita, by Vladimir Nabokov</h2>
    <hr>
     This book is fucked. It's great. But fucked. In a sentence, it is a story told by a pedophilic murderer from his
       side and his side only. His narration is unreliable as hell, as he is constantly rationalizing and justifying
       abhorrent behavior.
       <br><br>
       Being a famous book, I am at the luxury of borrowing interpretations from people far more intelligent and
       well-read than myself. Richard Rorty uses Lolita to explain the potential for cruelty in our quest for autonomy.
       The main character exhibits a tension between the passionate implementation of an authentic, life-affirming
       quest and the destruction of a innocent girl's life.
       <br><br>
       Others have connected Lolita to Nabokov's love of chess and his habit of designing difficult chess problems
       for other masters to solve. From thisp perspective, Naobokov wrote Lolita as the best argument possible for the
       systematic rape of a young person - or an expert troll. You know that, in the end, justice is served so
       your morally inspired squeemishness is quenched from chapter 1. To get the most out of the book, I suggest you
       extend your hand to Nabokov and be willing to sympathize with a violent pedophile.
        <br><hr>
       <b>Summary Part One:</b> Descriptively, Lolita is relatively straightforward, the narrator and protagonist
       Humbert Humbert has a decent upbringing despite the death of his mother at an early age. He has a young
       relationship at age 13 that doesn't result in sex despite both their intentions.

        <br>
       He grows up and makes money writing. He marries an adult woman despite a persistent attraction to
       <em>nymphets</em>, girls aged 9-14. The marriage dissolves when she has an affair but he doesn't seem to mind
       despite a subsequent trip to a mental hospital that should raise the reader's suspicions about the narrator's
       reliability. He is writing a memoir from prison that he doesn't want released until after he dies. He is a
       brilliant man that can rationalize anything, especially his abhorrent behavior.
       <br><br>
       His introduction to Lolita (short for Dolores) arises when he accepts an offer to live with a friend of the
       family. At this point the content of the book gets explicit where Humbert jerks it to Lolita a lot and cums in
       his pants when she sits on his lap. He's pathetic. But the book is written so well and so eloquently that you
       tend to forget Lolita is a child and Humbert is a piece of filth. It makes it very easy to forget the specifics
       of the situation and generalize Humbert's feelings beyond pedophilia to love, beauty, and the idiosyncratic
       aesthetics of life. When you snap back to the reality of a grown man cumming to a prepubescent girl, you are left
       understanding the fundamental motivations behind Humbert's actions that stem deeper than lust or hornyness.
       <br><br>
       Humbert, being an attractive, intelligent man, wins the affection of Lolita's mother and marries her to stay
       closer to Lolita. To stay sane, he keeps a diary that meticulously documents his feelings towards Lolita. While
       Lolita is off at summer camp, Lolita's mother finds the diary and confronts Humbert only to be serendipitously
       killed in a car crash as she storms out of the house. This promptly paints a picture of God's hand pointing to a
       fated Humbert/Lolita - destined to be together as he takes over as her stepfather.
       <br><br>
       Humbert picks her up from Summer camp and the psycho really comes out of him. He doesn't tell her her mom is dead
       for awhile, takes her on a trip where he gives her drugs so he can bang her, though he withdraws before the act.
       He finds out she had sex at camp so he manipulates her into having sex with him. As they continue their trip
       post-coitus, Humbert finally tells her that her mother is dead.

       <br>
       While all this is horrible to summarize, the trippy thing about the book is the quality of romantic descriptions
       Humbert gives of Lolita. Makes you forget she is a child and he is an adult creep. Even inspires you to find
       such passion in your own life (maybe).
       <br><br>
       <em>Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip
           of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.</em>
       <br><br>
       <em>All at once we were madly, clumsily, shamelessly, agonizingly in love with each other; hopelessly, I should
           add, because that frenzy of mutual possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and
           assimilating every particle of each other's soul and flesh; but there we were, unable even to mate as slum
           children would have so easily found an opportunity to do so.</em>
       <br><br>
       <em>All I want to stress is that my discovery of her was a fatal consequence of that 'princedom by the sea' in
           my tortured past. Everything between the two events was but a series of gropings and blunders, and false
           rudiments of joy.</em>
       <br><br>
       <em>Then she crept into my waiting arms, radiant, relaxed, caressing me with her tender, mysterious, impure,
           indifferent, twilight eyes--for all the world, like the cheapest of cheap cuties. For that is what nymphets
           imitate--while we moan and die.</em>
       <br><br>
       This is a man who loves a woman sincerely, except the woman is a pre-pubescent girl. It's so fucked up but
       so good at the same time. It really twists you and confuses you to try and like someone you despise.
       <br><br>
       <b>Summary Part Two:</b> The pair hit the road on a cross-country adventure filled with sex, arguments, and more
       professions of disgustingly but beautifully written love. Lolita enrolls in an all girls school and participates
       in a play despite Humbert's reluctance. He is losing control while Lolita grows up and strives
       for independence. Watching her age twists his intense passion with a fleeting age-dependent attraction. Paranoia,
       potentially justified, builds as Humbert suspects someone is following them and unaware of his alleged "crime".
       Importantly he sees himself as innocent and a victim of a flawed society which he routinely opines as an
       injustice against the greater, purer good of his love for Lolita. His jealously mounts from this insecurity
       and keeps close track on Lolita's behavior.

        <br>
       Lolita checks into a hospital where she briefly escapes Humbert's watch. Her absences triggers a kind of
       existential crisis where he resorts to abstract rationales for the interruption of their fated connection.
       He justifies it with a convoluted mess of external forces interfering with their love and pursues to no avail.
       He hooks up with an age-appropriate alcoholic for awhile but doesn't express any feelings near to his love for
       Lolita. Eventually, Lolita reaches out to him asking for money and telling him that she is married and pregnant
      (she is 17 now). He nonetheless tracks her down to find her with a man he's never seen before and that she has
       aged out of the nymphet phase deflating his passion for her but not his love.
       <br><br>
       Humbert gives her $4000 and Lolita tells him she ran away with a man named Quilty (also a pedophile), a previous
       acquaintance of them both and writer of the play Lolita participated in. She left Quilty after he tried to make
       her star in a child porn.
       <br><br>
       Humbert tracks down Quilty to find an opulent dwelling with a hedonistic atmosphere at his mansion. He confronts
       Quilty in his bedroom who doesn't believe he is really there to do him harm.
       <br><br>
       <em>
           All of a sudden I noticed that he had noticed that I did not seem to have noticed Chum protruding from
           beneath the other corner of the chest. We fell to wrestling again. We rolled all over the floor, in each
           other's arms, like two huge helpless children. He was naked and goatish under his robe, and I felt
           suffocated as he rolled over me. I rolled over him. We rolled over me. They rolled over him. We rolled
           over us.
       </em>
       <br><br>
       After a pathetic sounding fight, Humbert shoots him dead and he leaves to see guests at his house prepared for a
       licentious party. He is caught as he drives away and crashes his car.
       <br><br>
       <em>
           The following decision I make with all the legal impact and support of a signed testament: I wish this memoir
           to be published only when Lolita is no longer alive.
           <br><br>
            Thus, neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book. But while the blood still throbs through
           my writing hand, you are still as much part of blessed matter as I am, and I can still talk to you from here
           to Alaska. Be true to your Dick. Do not let other fellows touch you. Do not talk to strangers. I hope you
           will love your baby. I hope it will be a boy. That husband of yours, I hope, will always treat you well,
           because otherwise my specter shall come at him, like black smoke, like a demented giant, and pull him apart
           nerve by nerve. And do not pity C. Q. One had to choose between him and H.H., and one wanted H.H. to exist
           at least a couple of months longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. I am
           thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And
           this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita.
       </em>
       <br><br>
       <b>Analysis:</b> As I said earlier, this book is fucked but great. It is a deep dive into the head of a
       pathetic, sick man who has an intellect to con the reader into believing otherwise. Knowing this, many
       questions arise: if the reader believes Humbert is unambiguously depraved, why read a book from his perspective?
       What is there to gain? Any joy at the service of justice is quelled in the prologue. Are there lessons or
       insights to be gained from this work? Are we meant to question the validity and social construction of
       pedophilia/murder? In my view there are two answers to these questions.
       <br>

       <br>
       First, Nabokov wants us to understand a major limitation of rationality, or the process of identifying reasons
       and/or justifications for events, experiences, actions - usually done in accordance with some formal or
       informal set of rules. Humbert has no problem rationalizing his behavior and the just, even chivalrous,
       motivations behind it. The book often reads as a challenge to tell him why he can't live an authentic, honest,
       passion-driven life. He is fuller of life than you are! Lolita lived on, she has a husband and a kid.
       His joys clearly seem higher than her lows, is there some kind of utilitarian calculus that winds around this
       fact? I think not.
       <br><br>
       Further, what better founding axiom than an affirmation of life by pursuing authentic, uncorrupted passions? He
       is not motivated by external validation, god, self-interest, revenge, pleasure, or any other primitive drive
       expressed by the simple-minded. He is embodying love for love's sake and beauty for beauty's sake. In context,
       I see Nabokov as a jester to the primacy of rationality - a common modern (in the philosophical sense) view.
       If there is an inherent constraint to our lives, something "we" can't properly rationalize but indeed exists - how
       can we outline the metaphysical existence of these constraints outside a transcendent or divine vocabulary?
       I think the conclusion is we cannot, and secularism is on a far darker trajectory than most people realize.

        <br>
       The second point to derive from Lolita is the constraints of self-reflection and self authenticity. The man is
       writing a memoir that is to be withheld until his death. He will suffer no consequences from its reception
       yet still clearly lies to justify his own path. He is unanimously regarded as an unreliable narrator with his
       inconsistent recollections of Lolita's behavior, and sporadic emphasis on perplexing events. My uncommon opinion
       is that Nabokov is illustrating the the limitations of solitary constructed knowledge. Humbert does not exist
       in his own reality, at least not the real Humbert. Just like Lolita does not really get represented by Humbert's
       narration, no one can be by themselves. The self does not exist independent of other people. In fact,
       it only manifests as the agent connects with another person at a level Humbert has with Lolita - only one that
       is mutually reciprocated.
       <br><br>
       Just like rationality can lead to multiple answers to the same question - multiple notions of self can be
       derived by a person. The convergence evades our grasp. Humbert's authentic drive for Lolita is unreal, as he is
       unable to illustrate such authenticity alone. To put another way, he is not more authentic than any other
       person is when placed in the personal narrative they constructed.
