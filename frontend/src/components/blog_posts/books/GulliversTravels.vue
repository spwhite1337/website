    <h2>Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift</h2>
    <hr>
     Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's Travels, is a wild man and former dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in
       Dublin, Ireland. A member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriblerus_Club"
       target="_blank">Scriblerus Club </a>, he presented Gulliver's Travels as a satirical work that is mocking the
       fashionable philosophies of his time - those that we often call "The Enlightenment" - while also critiquing
       European politics, religions, and wars. He explores different notions of "reason" and their effect on societal
       organizations in a form of "comparative government".

        Pound for pound, the book is very rich. I will focus on two of the societies Gulliver travels too and outline
       the main lessons we can draw from Swift's analysis - the relationship between ancients / moderns and his
        criticism of Science. We get a glimpse into Swift's motivations through the protagonist and narrator about
        halfway through the novel.

        <em>
            I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the like particulars, which, however
            insignificant they may appear to groveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge
            his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as well as private life, which was my
            sole design in presenting this and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly
            studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning or of style. But the whole scene of this
            voyage made so strong an impression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it
            to paper I did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several
            passages. Of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling,
            whereof travellers are often, perhaps not without justice, accused.

       <b>Lilliput:</b> Gulliver is a trained surgeon who takes to sea after his patronage runs out. He finds himself
       shipwrecked and captured by a diminutive race of people - proportional humans shrunk to ~6 inches in height.
       They use Gulliver as a weapon against their long-term foes. His captivity is relieved when he shows mercy to
       officers who disobediently attacked him - something quite offensive to Lilliputian courts as they hold their
       culture and customs in high regard despite their ridiculousness (e.g. public officials almost literally
       jump through hoops to get appointed, people write diagonally). Their burial rituals coincide with their
       religion's eschatology - namely the eventual turning of the world (which they believe to be flat) upside down
       requiring the dead to be buried vertically, head-first. (As an interesting side note, Jonathan Swift was
       buried standing up in case of flooding).
        <br><br>
       The high societal crime of Lilliput is lying and, conversely, the principal value is trust. Deceit and false
       accusations in court (Bearing False Witness to One's Neighbor, if you will) are high crimes with severe
       punishments. But, as Gulliver finds, the desecration of courts and civil monuments is also grave and he is
       sentenced to blinding for urinating on the inflamed capital building. He eventually flees
       and takes a boat back to England.
        <br><br>
       <b>Analysis:</b> Lilliput is a great example of how arbitrary many cultural practices are. From the festivals to
       the resolution of conflicts in court - Swift satirizes these in a period of Imperial dominance from European
       colonizers. Despite some wise values, they also quarrel with neighboring tribes over trivial interpretations of
        legal texts, outline absurd requirements for government positions, and drastically overestimate their place in
        the universe.

        Contextualizing the work aids in this interpretation. In the 17th and 18th century Europe was the dominant global
        power with England on the up-and-up. Recent inventions such as paper and the sextant enabled exploration and
        colonizations of lands of legend to ancient thinkers prompting widespread ideologies of chauvinism and
        European / Ethno superiority. Swift mocks this notion with fictional society filled with comparably
        arbitrariness as 18th century England.
        <br><br>
        More broadly, he attacks the "moderns" in the ancient vs. moderns debate that was popular amongst philosophical
        circles at the time. Many saw the ancients (e.g. Aristotle, Plato, St. Paul) as outdated and irrelevant as we
        had progressed beyond them on a path of enlightenment. Highlighting the similarities between England and
        Lilliput puts the moderns adjacent to the ancients rather than beyond - undermining many myths of progress.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes referred to as a "flat" history, Swift's comparison between the ancients and moderns is absurd in
        particulars and complicated in the abstract. Of course the adoption of new technologies "advanced" society in a
        way, the only question is if they are "better" ethically / morally / politically. Swift doesn't really outline
        what it would mean for a society to be better or worse, and is in fact quite relativistic as he travels from
        country to country. But at a time of political hubris, raising the skeptical questions in an insightful,
        scathing manner can prove very useful.

       <b>Laputa:</b> After getting sent out to sea in a small boat, Gulliver finds himself on a floating island near
        Japan. The inhabitants are a powerful group of hyper-intelligent statesmen with grand ideas but no practical
        abilities. They have servants called, "Flappers", to aid their masters in conversation as their minds will
        frequently drift off into intellectual musings.

        Considerable efforts are directed towards astronomy where their high reason pays off, and they also find refuge
        in sophisticated music. More "political" efforts include the extraction of sunbeams from cucumbers and the
        analysis of excrement to diagnose a person's political ambitions.
       <br><br>
       <b>Analysis:</b> Science is a hard concept to critique, especially during times when it is the badge of the
        intellectual. But Swift nonetheless destroys ideas about "Science for Science's sake" or, more formally,
        "Knowledge for Knowledge's" sake with his depiction of Laputa.
        <br><br>
        Taken literally, the purity of science and the pure pursuit knowledge promoted by popular enlightenment figures
        like Francis Bacon is an absurdity. It is not only unfeasible to attain, but undesirable. The extreme
        abstraction from practicality leads to reclusive, socially inept scientists not so unlike the stereotype
        of Ph.D. scientists today (e.g. Ph.D. Chemical Engineers like myself).
         <br><br>

        Socially, the over-emphasis on science leads to a dump of resources into frivolous endeavors like the
        extraction of sunbeams from cucumbers, the trivial cataloguing of celestial bodies, or the determination of
        human nature by their bodily correlates. Modern examples about as we are currently deeply plagued with such
        a blind elevation of science against wise and humble approaches to our existences. The embodiment of this
        sickness is Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at CalTech. While he is undoubtedly very learned at skilled
        at quantum field theory and General Relativity, I fail to see the value of his work outside of its effect on his
        students and colleagues (an effect that is not unique to theoretical physics, but to good teachers - which I'm
        sure he is one). I strongly suspect he agrees as he spends much of his efforts "popularizing" his science and a
        post-Soviet strain of materialistic atheism. Luckily for Laputa, their abstracted intellectuals have lost the
        ability to promulgate their ideas to the uninitiated - the laziness of Sean Carroll's views make me wish he
        would follow suit. More humorously, he justifies his position due to its place in time after the victory of the
        moderns over the ancients. But if he would digest his Jonathan Swift more, he would see his views as a flat
        line from the works of Parmenides and other monists.
