    <h2>Cat's Cradle, by Kurt Vonnegut</h2>
    <hr>
       In my more youthful days Kurt Vonnegut was one of my favorite authors with Cat's Cradle my favorite book of his.
       The black humor and absurdist underpinning kept me thoroughly entertained as I flew through a book making serious
       points with a not-so-serious tone and context. Vonnegut manages to attack religion, science, nation-states, and
       himself all in a quick-read about a not-so-fictional universe that ends up decimating itself.
       <br><hr>
       <b>Summary:</b> The book tracks John (Jonah?) as he strives to document the descendants of an inventor of the
        atomic bomb, Felix Hoenniker, in post-WWII america. In the process he explores the role of science in shaping
        the worldviews of its advocates along with science's ability to amplify violence through mass industrialized
        killing. Quickly, John learns that Felix has also discovered a substance called <em>ice-nine</em>, a phase of
        H2O that catalyzes the freezing of water even at room temperature. This is even more destructive than the atomic
        bomb as it could effectively wipe out all humanity and life on earth with just a single stray specimen.

       His journey brings him to San Lorenzo, a primitive island nation that is ostensibly Christian but practically
       Bokononist - a religion that is explicitly based on lies and untruths. The island is governed by
       a dictatorship with punishments issued by impalement on a large hook. Bokononism holds human relationships sacred
       while nesting them in a belief system that is palpably cynical, nihilistic, relativistic, and pessimistic. It
       was founded by Bokonon and a U.S. Marine deserter in order to control the population.
       <br><br>
       The ruler of San Lorenzo is revealed to be in poor health and hopes to pass his reign to Franklin, a descendant of
       the famous scientist, who rapidly transfers power to John. The ruler then kills himself and his doctor with
        <em>ice-nine</em>.
       <br><br>
       Decontamination proceeds, but a catastrophic turn of fate leads to a plane crash spilling the <em>ice-nine</em>
       contaminated body into the ocean that will inevitably lead to a worldwide freezing of water and the death of
       billions (this is scientific nonsense but the point is that <em>ice-nine</em> is a high-end technology
       that is bad for humans, and our inability to control it will be our downfall.).
       <br><br>
       John and his new wife (betrothed when he took rule) hide away in a secret bunker until the storms subside. They
       emerge to find the inhabitants of San Lorenzo dead of mass suicide, John is rescued after some time when he
       wrote the memoirs that are revealed to be the book, Cat's Cradle.

       The finale entails a meeting between John and Bokonon himself who is finishing the founding text of Bokononism
       "The Book of Bokonon". In the aftermath of all this destruction, Bokonon longs for a chance to do the whole
       thing over and initiate the <em>ice-nine</em> catastrophe years before while flipping off God. It is suggested
       that John intends to the do the same after the book.
    <br><br>
       <b>Truthful Truths and Truthful Lies and Lying Truths:</b> The principal concept explored in Cat's Cradle, and
      most if not all of Vonnegut's work, is the falsity of Truth and its pernicious forms in religion, humanism,
      nationalism, scientism, etc. I would categorize these all together as "belief systems that give its adherents
      meaning and purpose through unjustified claims of Truth and coherence". The title corresponds to a pointless,
      boundless game involving playing with string to make shapes without any winning, losing, or direction in mind.
      Most accurately, Cat's Cradle connects this game to activities like nation building, waging war, or seeking
      meaning/purpose in life.
      <br><br>
      Being a WWII vet, Vonnegut hits particularly hard on Scientism or the belief that
      technical progress is synonymous with moral progress. The best example is Asa Breed, Felix's former/current boss,
      who can't even understand alternative approaches to problems outside of technical means. For her (and many
      techno-futurist types) science is the One True Way which Vonnegut promptly mocks by noting the scientific
      achievement of atomic war:
      <br><br>
      <em>I thought scientists were going to find out exactly how everything worked, and then make it work better. I
          fully expected that by the time I was twenty-one, some scientist, maybe my brother, would have taken a color
          photograph of God Almightyâ€”and sold it to Popular Mechanics magazine. Scientific truth was going to make us
          so happy and comfortable. What actually happened when I was twenty-one was that we dropped scientific truth
          on Hiroshima.</em>
      <br><br>
      The best scientist in the novel, Felix Hoenikker, is portrayed as obviously misanthropic and in no position to
      make serious claims about morality. Felix and his colleagues exemplify 19th / Early 20th century notions of
      'rationality' through their scientific brilliance and its corresponding fruits that include the atomic bomb and
      <em>ice-nine</em>. At their core, the scientists in the novel are just as irrational as the rest. Vonnegut's
      clear expression is instill scientism with the human agents behind it in order to undermine the
      safety and reliability of technical and / or scientific progress.
      <br><br>
      Felix, the inventor of Ice-Nine, represents the proper depiction of a scientifically grounded worldview.
       He is disinterested in the effects of his inventions on humans feigning ignorance when accused of committing
       Science's first "sin" with his role in the atomic bomb. Not ignorance of the negative effects, ignorance of
       sin itself. He has no interest in books, stories, etc. But has a mechanical life and is a horrible father.

       Cat's Cradle.</a>
       <br><br>
       Vonnegut routinely mocks notions of scientific progress and the pursuit of truth for truth's sake. A clear
       refutation of Enlightenment notions that underlie most secular techno-futurists or liberal progressives.
      Scientists represent the paragon of truth and rationality for Vonnegut and serve as a easy target. Similarly, the
      "reasonable" government of San Lorenzo is still fundamentally governed by "irrational" passions and motives.
      <br><br>
      <b>Political Activism:</b> Vonnegut is a veteran of WWII's Dresden affair leading him to have a defining
      anti-war stance in his politics and activism during the 1960s. Cat's Cradle expounds on this stance by merging
      Vonnegut's critiques of Religion (i.e. Christianity) with those of Nations, politics, or science. It is not so
      easy, in Vonnegut's view, to escape the hubris of religious dogmatism.
        <br><br>

      Nationalities and nation-states are routinely ridiculed as harmful, pointless lies used to manipulate and
      rule through this work (Also see the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hobsbawm">
      Eric Hobsbawn</a>) through the overlap between national and religious leaders and institutions. WWII saw a clash
      of nations that shaped their countries around their very existence - Nazis, Fascists, and Communists - making the
      distinction between politics and religion one of semantics rather than responsibility. Nonetheless, it is
      routinely presented as <em>necessary</em> for Bokonon to exist, the truthfulness or falsity is irrelevant.
      <br><br>
      Vonnegut continues to deconstruct national myths with the example of San Lorenzo by using it to implicitly and
      explicitly mock American's myth. San Lorenzo is a small island that is idealized by some americans (a type of
      infantilization from Americans that makes then the stoic adult) and a business opportunity for others,
      i.e. "Of Course they want to work for great American companies!". Vonnegut often references to the
       Hundred Martyrs to Democracy, a group San Lorenzo soldier sunk by a the Germans as they went to aid the U.S. after
       Pearl Harbor was bombed. They're remembered as heroes despite the obvious futility of their adventure in order
       to maintain the untruth of the necessity and valor of war.
      <br><br>
     <b>Traditional Religion as a Pack of Lies:</b> The logic of Bokononism is intentionally nonsensical. Religions
     aren't conclusions of formal logical rules, they are primarily mechanisms of social cohesion to maintain a society
      made of up of passionate and irrational human beings. Bokononism strips religion down to its essence by its focus
      on interpersonal relationships and holds them as sacred. It has no outline of self-development beyond what amounts
      to relationship advice. It has a cynical creation story that connects to its pessimistic eschatology. Ultimately,
     Bokonism is all that religion needs to be and the rest is a veneer of lies and untruths.
      <br><br>
      Vonnegut is very much in line with the rise of "spiritual but not religious" people, or someone
      who thinks Jesus was a good guy but doesn't think he did miracles or outlined a True metaphysics. Bokonism and
      Christianity inevitably arise as humans work together, but they aren't True in any proper sense.
     <br><br>
      <captioned-image

              position="left" size="30%">
      </captioned-image>
      <b>Determinism and Pessimism:</b>
       Like the Calvinist notion of Total Depravity, Bokononists don't see any role for "free will" or individual
      agency in the course of events. In Vonnegut's world, blind luck is the dominate agent of world events as
      exemplified by the discovery of <em>ice-nine</em> (a dog licked it and instantly froze to death), John's
      ascension to the presidency (he goes to an island on a whim to find the rule near death), to the final
      destruction of the world (a plane randomly crashes and spills the <em>ice-nine</em> contaminated body.
      <br><br>
      As a consequence, there is no notion of redemption or self-actualizing purpose in Bokononism. One can be a
      Bokononist in a Christian state because Bokonism does not call its adherents to duty in any kind of social
      organization or political context. In fact, Bokononists aren't really called to any "beliefs" but rather
      actions and rituals.
      <br><br>
      The lack of agency naturally lends to a pessimistic view of humanity and the future. Hubris is inevitable,
      stupidity governs us, and tragedy awaits us. Vonnegut outlines such a view with a black, quick humor that
      keeps you entertained despite subtly telling you your life is meaningless and your sacrifices were for nothing.
       <br><br>
      <b>What is truth then?:</b>
      Despite his pessimism, Vonnegut still promotes relationships and the
       significance of "togetherness" when living out a life. He mocks Christian notions of "God is Love" by adopting
       the role of a skeptic and asking, "What is God and what is Love?". Vonnegut's skepticism is more
      about about skeptical of rationalized beliefs rather than acted out or embodied beliefs, as it is not "false" to
      love humans, only false to claim you know why you are doing it.
    <br><br>
    <captioned-image

            position="right" size="30%">
    </captioned-image>
      Vonnegut is famous example of a "Humanist", or a member of a religion or lifestance that holds human beings as
      sacred absent the transcendent or supernatural (The American Humanist Association held Vonnegut as a Humanist of
      the Year in 1992 and honorary president). To me, this grossly contradicts his works like Cat's Cradle. Of course
      there is no <em>reason</em> or purpose to becoming a Humanist, nor is there any meaning to the lives of Humanists
       as a consequence of joining Humanism, but the actions of humanists are directed by the creeds and tenets of the
      humanist lifestance.
    <br><br>
    I can't help but connect Bokonism and Vonnegut's contempt for Christianity with his adoption of Humanism. I don't
    know how he sees it as different. I don't know why he thinks Humanism is an answer where Christianity or
    Bokononism is not. Maybe he doesn't, maybe he lived more pessimistically and nihilistically than I assume. But it
    always very confusing to me when authors write novels about the mirage of Truth and the futility of morally
    motivated organization or the proclamation of meaning and purpose in life but accept positions like the
    President of the Humanists? Is Humanism not providing what you write against? I'm sure Vonnegut has an answer, but
    know many Humanists don't.
