    <h2>American Gods, by Neil Gaiman</h2>
    <hr>
     <b>Summary:</b> The story of American Gods follows a familiar mythological
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey" target = "_blank">structure</a>, as it follows a
     hero's journey that is seen in countless other works. The protagonist, Shadow, is introduced at a low point in his
     life (he is in prison and immediately finds out his wife is dead and was cheating on him.), gets called to an
     adventure where he meets a diverse mixture of characters (accepts a job as a driver for a shady fellow,
     Mr. Wednesday), the following events force him to reinvent himself as he seeks to right the wrongs with the society
     he is re-entering (sacrifices himself to prevent a war). He finds himself at the intersection of a more important
     and far-reaching conflict and plays a central role in its resolution. Where American Gods really differentiates
     itself is with the adept use of cynicism and humor mixed with an insightful connection to American culture that,
     for a Brit, was extremely well researched. American Gods has a discernible and readable structure that mirrors many
     other fantasy stories but occurs in an exciting universe and ends with a suspenseful and entertaining conclusion.

     <br>
      The ontology of the universe is one where anthropomorphic gods very much exist, but that existence is proportional
      to the people's belief in them. As new gods arise the old gods fade into obscurity. The heterogeneous nature of
      American history presents a network of conflicts between these rising and falling gods as Shadow adventures
      along with Wednesday and team. The principal conflict is between the Old gods (led by Mr. Wednesday or Odin)
      and the New gods such as Mr. Town, Mr. Corporation, and Media (A pantheon of Liberal / Capitalist gods).
     <br><br>
      The protagonist's name, Shadow, foreshadows (no pun intended) his journey.
      He begins as a man who sees the world with contempt but as he learns he is the son of
      an Old God (Odin) and was intended to serve as a sacrifice that would expand Odin's power, he becomes a more
      active participant in the world around him. He rebukes Odin's plan through self-sacrifice and prevents a wider
      clash between the old gods and new gods. Succinctly, he exists as a shadow of the Old gods that must be confronted
      before he (and American society by extension) advance beyond them.

      <br>
      <b>Shadow's</b> self-agency closely tracks the page count of the book. He is literally imprisoned at the start but
      becomes a more proactive player in the climax rather than a reactive victim.
      In addition to the core focus of the novel, I view his progression as that of a man who fulfills his external call
      of significance to become a "god" and rebuke the course nature set him on. For the first half of the book Shadow is
      a tumbling spectator thrown from town to town while Mr. Wednesday is recruiting for a "war" he is wary of
      participating in. Often portrayed as 'simple-minded', his questions serve as useful expositions about the nature
      of the universe. He is confused and frustrated by the complexities and ambiguities of his experience with Mr.
      Wednesday. And, despite being a con-man himself, finds himself the victim of a con by Odin and Loki (who was
      also his close friend in prison).
     <br><br>
     Shadow periodically sees or "oversees" into an alternative reality as a consequence of his divinity. Initially he
      experiences these visions with awe but, over the course of the novel, he actively participates and utilizes them
      to uncover insights into his significance. The visions serve as useful milestones for Shadow's progression
      from man-to-god and the manifestation of his divine nature for the reader to track. The culmination of his
      divinity is at the climax of the novel where he is sacrificed on Odin's behalf but rebukes his death (like only
      an immortal god can) and returns to prevent the chaotic battle between the old gods and the new.

      <b>Setting and Physics:</b> The most fun part of the novel is the ontology of this universe, namely the
      idea that existence stems from people's belief or things exist if people believe in them and their associated
      power is proportional to the conviction behind the belief. As expressed by Mr. Towns towards the end of the novel,
      <em>"The symbol is the thing"</em>. This makes an eclectic mixture of gods personified throughout the landscape
      representing the strange and undefinable culture of settled America. The YouTube channel StoryDive clearly agrees with me and has a great
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_lpQDc5pHE" target = "_blank">set of videos</a> chronicling the
      connections with historical mythology. An important consequence of this philosophy is that "theism" is unavoidable
      as represented by the "new gods" of an ostensibly atheistic America: Media, Mr. World, Mr. Towns, Technology Boy,
      Mr. Corporation, etc. Rather than constructing pyramids for their holy ruler, modern religions construct
      skyscrapers for their corporations. Rather than attend weekly service at church to discuss moral teachings, they
      tune into their weekly shows and discuss the consequences to their "fictional" characters. While this comparative
      religion framework can be fun, it can be very difficult to articulate the important differences between "religions"
      across time beyond banal trivialities. Neil Gaiman doesn't really consider those differences likely to avoid the
      controversial aspects of such a debate (I assume).
     <br><br>
      This philosophy is a very useful lens to think about historical cultures where gods were ubiquitous. In what are
      called "pagan" or "traditional" religions or mythologies the gods were worshipped so they (the objects of worship)
      would be stronger, or so that the followers of the god would get what they wanted (harvest, victory in war, etc.).
      It was sacrifices to these gods that largely determined the course of the future and the direction the society of
      god-worshippers would head. Christianity differentiates itself from this relationship between man and god by
      constructing a universe where God is worshipped for the sake of the worshipper themself. One prays to Jesus so
      they will be saved, not so that Jesus will be more powerful or so that "Christianity" will strengthen. It is a
      personal relationship that is very different from the Norse, Greek, Roman, Native American, or Egyptian
      mythologies featured in American Gods. Buddhism is quite similar to Christianity in this regard.
      (DISCLAIMER: I don't know enough about Islam or Judaism to compare them. Their omission is not indicative of
      my opinion towards them. Though I think Islam is similar to Christianity while Judaism is too complicated for me.)
     <br><br>
     The "main quest" set out by Mr. Wednesday is motivated by this underlying ontology. If Mr. Wednesday (Odin) can
      get the old gods to fight the new gods (Technology, Television, etc.) then his power will increase due to the
      resulting shifts in the populations' belief and Loki (his brother) will thrive in the chaos. While solid, the
      plan is thwarted by Shadow and Laura (Shadow's dead wife) who transform throughout the work into active agents
      in the construction of their path in life. Shadow (and Laura) see the misdirection of Mr. Wednesday and Loki
      and prevent their hopeful sacrifices from occurring. In the process, Shadow saves his own life and resolves his
      issues with Laura enabling her to reach final death.
     <br><br>
     <b>Setting:</b> What really makes this work for me is the setting. It is America, modern times but focuses on
      often neglected areas of the midwest. The protagonist, Shadow, visits the Upper Peninsula, Wisconsin,
      Minnesota, Kansas, and more. You can find references to football, lakes, drinking, the dull of small town life
      along with the bizarre underlying drama. Gaiman clearly did his research because, as a Midwest Native, I thought
      it very spot-on and hilarious to read.

     <br>
     A special shout out is due for Lakeside, a quaint and orderly town that maintains structure through ritualistic
      child sacrifices to the lake goblin. Maybe I'm reading into this scene too much, but I think it is Neil Gaiman
      giving a nod to all the towns in the American midwest that are entirely interchangeable and generic on the
      surface but deep down they have a (usually dark) backstory that can be a founding story, a criminal event,
      or a notorious member. For example, my hometown of Dubuque, IA earned a spot in the
      <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-24/news/mn-133_1_integration-plan" target = "_blank">national
          conversation</a> when a group belonging to the "National Association for the Advancement of White People"
      burnt a cross outside an elementary school run by a black man. If you just drove through, you would expect
      nothing to ever happen in Dubuque apart from Sunday mass and riverside parties.
      <br><br>
      But maybe I'm wrong and he is just an ardent follower of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard"
      target="_blank">Rene Girard</a>
      <br><br>
      <b>Laura:</b> The characters are too many to enumerate here, but Laura deserves elaboration. She is the
      cheating wife who died with Shadow's friend's cock in her mouth right before Shadow's release from prison
      for the crime she encouraged him to commit. She comes back as a zombie due to a "strike of luck" and connects
      with Shadow at various points in his adventure. Naturally hateable, she begins as a representation of all the
      things men tend to hate about women and relationships - untrustworthy, manipulating, demanding, and needy. She
      has almost no beliefs, no drives, and just "goes with the flow" subjected to external forces leading her to
      shit on those around her.
     <br><br>
     As the story goes on she is burdened with extreme regret as a zombie working night shifts with decaying flesh
      and the knowledge that she could have had a better life if she more assertively took direction for her
      relationships and personal life. She ends the story as a victorious killer of Loki and a central player
      in the story's resolution and prevention of the cataclysmic war between the gods.
     <br><br>
     So, like most great characters she SERIOUSLY "out kicks her coverage" and performs well above any standard you
      would expect given her backstory. There is probably a parallel to feminism and sexism in America but I'll
      leave that analysis to someone else
      (<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4d8m5/american-gods-wasnt-as-deep-of-a-book-as-you-remember"
          target = "_blank">VICE gives a predictable critique here if you care what VICE says about anything.</a>).
      I see her as a character that similarly "came to life" after death as did Shadow. He death was slow, and boring,
      and tragic but nonetheless necessary for her to be fully realized.
     <br><br>
     <b>Jesus and Contemporary America Connection:</b> Probably the most intriguing aspect of American Gods is that it
      is written by a Secular Brit. This leads into the most puzzling omission from the American pantheon - Jesus.
      He is given only a passing nod in the novel and sarcastic depiction in the TV series
      (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTH-hf_0rA" target = "_blank">Mexican Jesus, a black Jesus, a
      White Jesuit Jesus</a>) who doesn't do much more than walk on water. This is extra puzzling because the
      ontology of the universe would suggest he ought to be extremely prominent in America likely featuring
      on both the "old gods" and "new gods" pantheon due to the reinvigoration of Christianity throughout
      American history (e.g. Great Awakenings).
     <br><br>
     Theories abound as to why Jesus was omitted, Neil himself hinted that it was too much to chew with all the
      other (primarily Norse) deities in his universe. I'm not sure I buy it, I think Jesus is too difficult to
      incorporate into a universe with gods vying for power and authority. Jesus defines authority and power very
      differently making it quite intractable to imagine him "fighting a war" for followers. I simply don't think
      Jesus is compatible with an adventure story like this one.
     <br><br>
     Having said that, I did enjoy the way the show (not the novel) differentiated all the culturally specific
      versions of Jesus. Reminds me of scenes from Oz where Schillinger mocks the Muslims in his prison for
      thinking Jesus wasn't white (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTdpt83vzNA&t=5m12s" target = "_blank">
      Clip, 'you're getting awful mouthy prag'</a>). It's also reflective of the clear contradictions when stories of
      gods are told and retold whether it is Jesus (e.g. the last words in Luke are very different than those in Mark)
      or Odin or Greek versions of Zeus or Egyptian gods or whatever.
     <br><br>
     Finally, the metaphysics of the universe is perfect for America with gods coming and going and fighting and
      bickering. In fact, I would say that this story could only ever work in America with its historical resistance to
      any stable definition. America hasn't even been around 300 years but it has more cultural manifestations across
      time and space than one could possibly tackle in a novel much less a blog post. If you have any skepticism
      towards this claim, just consider the idea of "rights" in America. We've never had a clue what those ever
      meant nor who they applied to. Did all people have free speech throughout America? Does anyone have absolute
      free speech? What about religion? What does women's rights mean? What does worker's rights mean? What about
      rich people's rights? What about racists' rights?
      <br><br>
      Generally speaking, we make it up as we go and the "rights" are expressed by the beliefs in certain gods (to
      adopt Mr. Gaiman's analogy). The cultural god that is most powerful will draw the most criticism whether that
      is the Northern Industrialists abolishing slavery in the  South, the anti-communists during the Vietnam War, or
      the anti-immigration folks today (do we have a 'right' to protect the border or do the immigrants have a 'right'
     for a better life?).
      <br><br>
      If I had to guess, I suspect this feature is what drew Neil Gaiman to integrate himself into American culture
      itself and it likely rubbed off on him considerably. The most explicit articulation of someone's personal
      philosophy is in Interlude 3 where Sam is explaining herself to shadow and is also endorsed by Neil Gaiman
      as the closest to his personal views:
     <br><br>
     "<em>I can believe in things that are true and I can believe things that aren't true and I can believe things
      where nobody knows if they're true or not. I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and Marilyn
      Monroe and the Beatles and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen: I believe that people are perfectible, that knowledge is
      infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones
      that look like wrinkledly lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe
      that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going
      to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems
      communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie
      theatres from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that
      they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one
      comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that
      antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped
      out by the common cold like the Martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the
      last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of
      years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind's destiny lies in
      the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible
      for a bumblebee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive
      and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two
      different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe
      itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in
      an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even
      know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chasos, background noise and sheer
      blind luck. I believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that
      anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty
      and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human
      life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and
      that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe that life is a game, life is a cruel joke
      and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it."

     And trust me, the context doesn't help much.
     <br><br>
     <b>Conclusion:</b> American Gods is a great fantasy book, hero story, and adventure that exceeds generic
      expectations due to it's creative setting and philosophy. For the contemporary American, it's great to get
      you thinking of "Republican gods" and "Progressive gods" and "Feminist gods" and "Trump gods" of all sorts as
      the populations belief's give them power to alter the world by defeating and controlling other gods. The
      obvious question for the reader is, "Which god's side are you on?". Me, I'm probably on something like a
      Christianity and Science god (but not a 'Christian Science' god) and, if I'm being honest, a money god. But
      I also very sympathetic to Sam's speech in that I don't really believe anything other than the belief that you
      all don't know what you're talking about.
