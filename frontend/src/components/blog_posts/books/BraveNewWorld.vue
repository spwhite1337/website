    <h2>Draft Post, Shield your eyes</h2>
    <h2>Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley</h2>
    <hr>
     Rationally optimizing society. An endeavor that only makes sense in the abstract world of politics and theoretical
       societal structures, but fails at the level of a contradictory human. Brave New World is a dystopian novel that
       takes seriously the progressive arguments of techno-futurists in the early 20th century and takes them to their
       horrifying conclusions.
    <br><br>
        More interestingly, it is a novelizations of Nietzsche's ideas about <em>The Last Man</em> and his critiques of
    Liberal Capitalism and Enlightenment reason. Such a topic is beyond the scope of my capabilities but might get
    revisited in another post someday.

<b>Summary:</b> Set in the 26th Century, Europe had reached it goals of a scientific, progressive, and stable society.
    The World State cultivates its citizens into different castes that are conditioned to fully in a manner that is
    mutually beneficially for them and for society as a whole. They find immense joy out of consuming material goods,
    satiating their sexual appetites, and consuming Soma - a psychoactive pharmaceutical that is generously distributed
    by the World State.
    <br><br>
    To enable their profound scientific progress in genetic engineering and psychology, the culture of the World
    State is one of Extreme individualism with a group identity engineered by caste: Alphas are the highest while
    gammas are the lowest. Ostensibly the system functions perfectly, but cracks form as seen through two alphas:
    Bernard and Helmholtz. Bernard is an alienated psychologist while Helmholtz is a bored writer.
    <br><br>
    Despite being an alpha, Bernard doesn't fit in well in the World State and suspect he was accidentally subjected to
    alcohol during his birth - resulting in him being a "small" alpha and inspiring insecurities. After causing some
    trouble he ventured to the outskirts of society and meets John, man who grew up outside the hyper-scientific
    individualism of the World State and instead developed among a pseudo-Native American tribe while learning
    english from the works of Shakespeare.
    <br><br>
    Bernard brings John back to the world state where he bonds with the bored and literary-minded Helmholtz. He is
    appalled by the citizenry's aversion to familial bonds, love, God, and their addiction to Soma. Much unrest
    ensues as the outsider forces the citizens to reflect on the assumptions of their technocratic culture. John is
    eventually presented to Mond, one of the top ten ranking officials of the World State.

    Mond lifts the curtain of society and outlines the mechanisms only referenced implicitly prior in the novel. The
    mechanisms of consumption and labor, Soma and sex, conditioning and suppression serve to elevate stability and
    "rationality" of the World State. The god of the State survives from the sacrifice of citizen's agency and humanity.
    Importantly, Mond doesn't really outline a "point" to the society other than the avoidance of bad things and
    stability and order they have glorified. John categorically rejects Mond's philosophy on the grounds it contradicts
    human nature.
    <br><br>
    After the conversation John's countenance deteriorates rapidly. He attempts to exile himself to a lighthouse to
    adopt a monkish and ascetic lifestyle. To his chagrin, the citizens follow and spectate his strange behavior akin
    to watching a zoo exhibit. Ultimately, he self-flagellates and hangs himself.
    <hr>
    <b>Marx and Liberalism:</b> Huxley brilliantly examines philosophies of politics and society in parallel with
    more substantive philosophies of humanity and human nature. Bernard's surname is not coincidentally Marx after the
    famous Viennese as his ideas permeate the World State's culture. The society is designed scientifically and the
    labor of the lower classes is utilized by the upper classes in accordance with the order of design. Importantly,
    Marx saw this as intermediate stage towards the final Utopia in contrast to the World State's view of these
    oppressive labor relations as the end in itself.
    <br>

    The paradigm of rationality hypothesizes answers to a question then determines an optimal selection based on
    experimentation and deductive reasoning. Marx hypothesized and selected "Equality" as the answer to, "What is the
    best society?" and used a scientific analysis of the mechanisms of society deduce an economic revolution to
    achieve it. Importantly, neither Marx or other Enlightenment-era proponents of rationality analyze the axiomatic
    assumptions of their society nor do they question their goals. The World State has adopted this paradigm when they
    take "Stability" as an unquestioned goal of their society and the utilization of science as an undoubted route to
    said goal.
    <br><br>
    John is the outlier in their model, one who comes from outside with a different language that simply can't account
    for the axioms underlying the World State. Only Mond has the ability to see the axioms of the Worst State as they
    are in light of John's existence, while other citizens simply see him as crazy, confused, or contaminated. To put
    another way, they must question the humanity of John rather than the validity of their view of humanity.

    The citizen's communal identity parallels Marx's communitarian idea of human relations. They don't have
    families, nor do they have long-term romantic relationship. <em>Everyone belongs to everyone else</em> in a stable,
    functioning World State. In contrast, the relation between castes is a liberal-capitalist view that groups people
    not axiomatically (like Marx would) but as a "natural" outgrowth of different roles in a hierarchically ordered and
    economic based society. Both are fused together in Brave New World in a seamless manner that, I believe, is
    remarkably prescient for the disconnected sub-cultures I experience in 21st century America.
    <br><br>
    At the societal level, Huxley portrays the World State as a irony-riddled satire of modern dreams of science and
    rationality. He takes seriously the claims of big-brain pseudo-revolutionaries who believe that passion, emotion,
    faith, hope, etc. ought to have no place in politics and ethics as we can take care of that ourselves. This book
    and the history of the 20th century should give pause to anyone who thinks our successes in natural philosophy can
    be carried over to the humanities.

    <b>God, The Ubermensch, and The Last Man:</b> The world state citizens are the last men, John and Helmoltz are
    failed Ubermensch, God is the functional mechanism that destroys the Ubermensch and his function is replaced /
    improved upon by the scientific progress.

        "Quite so. I'll read you one of the things he did dream of in a moment. Meanwhile, listen to what this old
        Arch-Community-Songster said." He opened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to read.
        "'We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme
        over ourselves. We are not our own masters. We are God's property. Is it not our happiness thus to view the
        matter? Is it any happiness or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? It may be thought so by the young
        and prosperous. These may think it a great thing to have everything, as they suppose, their own way–to depend
        on no one–to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment,
        continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another. But as time goes on, they, as
        all men, will find that independence was not made for man–that it is an unnatural state–will do for a while,
        but will not carry us on safely to the end …'" Mustapha Mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up
        the other, turned over the pages. "Take this, for example," he said, and in his deep voice once more began
        to read: "'A man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of
        discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling
        his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as
        from an illness, he hopes to recover. Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it
        is. They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as
        they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such
        terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the
        passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes
        less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be
        absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all
        light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and
        charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions
        from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never
        play us false–a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this
        religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes
        up to us for all our other losses.'" Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. "One of the
        numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn't dream about was this" (he waved his hand),
        "us, the modern world. 'You can only be independent of God while you've got youth and prosperity; independence
        won't take you safely to the end.' Well, we've now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. What follows?
        Evidently, that we can be independent of God. 'The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.'
        But there aren't any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. And why should we go
        hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions,
        when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? What need have we of repose when our minds
        and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable,
        when there is the social order?"
