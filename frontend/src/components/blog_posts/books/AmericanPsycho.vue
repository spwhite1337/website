   <h2>American Psycho, by Bret Easton Ellis</h2>
   <hr>
     American Psycho's protagonist, Patrick Bateman, is a personification of American capitalism,
       albeit a cartoonish and narrow version exemplified by 1980s greed and the anarchy of Wall
       Street stock trading. He is vacuous, beastly, driven by external validation (as opposed to an internal conscience),
       amoral, and (most importantly) soulless. On first glance, the ending seems to inspire eyerolls with the reality
       of the story brought into question in the final minutes. But I will argue that this is perfectly coherent and
       consistent with the character - which is actually a non-character in a non-story. If there is a point to the
       story, its that a story about the personification of Capitalism is pointless and meaningless. A notion that
       treats relationships, jobs, and marriage as significantly as it treats murder, rape, and cannibalism. Namely,
       not significantly.

       <b>Summary:</b> The story focuses on one character, Patrick Bateman, and his existence as a high end wall street
       account manager. While impressive on paper, his job is deeply blended with his social life with little-to-no
       emphasis on his actual profession. He explains his job to flirt with women, but he never actually says what
       his description is. He has business meetings, but they never talk about business.

       Instead, his life, relationships, and work revolve around his position in a social hierarchy defined by external
      appearance, job title, and wealth. He constantly obsesses with clothing, exercise, beauty products, musical tastes
      (even though the music is very generic), and (in one of the greatest scenes of all-time)
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISYzA36-ZY" target = "_blank"> Business Cards</a>.
       <br><br>
       In a violent, graphic, and grotesque display of writing Patrick Bateman embarks in escalating acts of depravity.
       The extent to which the acts are grotesque is not really the point, but rather the fact that Bateman can get up
       the next day unphased.
      <br><br>
       One of many examples is presented here and was selected because it made me laugh out loud in absurdity.
       <br><br>
       <em>
       I lean in above her and shout, over her
       screams, "Try to scream, scream, keep screaming..." I've opened all the windows and the door to my
       terrace and when I stand over her, the mouth opens and not even screams come out anymore, just
       horrible, guttural, animal-like noises, sometimes interrupted by retching sounds. "Scream, honey," I
       urge, "keep screaming," I lean down, even closer, brushing her hair back. "No one cares. No one will
       help you..." She tries to cry out again but she's losing consciousness and she's capable of only a
       weak moan. I take advantage of her helpless state and, removing my gloves, force her mouth open and
       with the scissors cut out her tongue, which I pull easily from her mouth and hold in the palm of my
       hand, warm and still bleeding, seeming so much smaller than in her mouth, and I throw it against the
       wall, where it sticks for a moment, leaving a stain, before falling to the floor with a tiny wet slap.
       Blood gushes out of her mouth and I have to hold her head up so she won't choke. Then I fuck her in the
       mouth, and after I've ejaculated and pulled out, I Mace her some more.
       <br><br>
       Later, when she briefly regains consciousness, I put on a porkpie hat I was given by one of my
       girlfriends freshman year at Harvard. <br>
       "Remember this?" I shout, towering over her. "And look at this!" I scream triumphantly, holding up
       a cigar. "I still smoke cigars. Ha. See? A cigar." I light it with steady, bloodstained fingers, and
       her face, pale to the point of blueness, keeps contracting, twitching with pain, her eyes, dull with
       horror, close, then open halfway, her life reduced to nightmare. <br>
          "And another thing," I yell, pacing. "It's not Garrick Anderson either. The suit is by Armani!
       Giorgio Armani." I pause spitefully and, leaning into her, sneer. "And you thought it was Henry
       Stuart. Jesus." I slap her hard across the face and hiss the words "Dumb Bitch," spraying her face
       with spit, but it's covered with so much Mace that she probably can't even feel it, so I Mace her
       again and then I try to fuck her in the mouth once more but I can't come so I stop.
            <br><br>
       THURSDAY
            <br><br>
       Later, the next night in fact, three of us, Craig McDermott, Courtney and myself, are in a cab heading
       toward Nell's and talking about Evian water......
       </em>
      <br><br>
      The story zig-zags between inner monologues about minutiae, grotesque violent acts, elaborate social gossip,
      and insider business deals. While the violence sharply increases, the other aspects of his life are largely
      meander aimlessly.

      He starts with a girlfriend, advances to engagement with zero romance, breaks it off
      over dinner, they get back together, etc. There are big accounts at work that come and go, we aren't given
      an elaboration of their significance, nor are we even told what professional role Bateman plays.
      Meanwhile, sis violence systematically escalates and culminates with an axe murder of his competitor and friend,
      Paul Allen. I repeat, the idea is to blend these extreme contrasts in Bateman's experiences in a character
     that goes about them unfeeling. Bateman is nothing, just a mechanism or system that requires constant validation
     to persist. He is an embodiment of Capitalism and vacuous, greed-driven lifestyle.
      <br><br>
     <b>Finale:</b> In the final chapters after the murder of Paul Allen, Patrick Bateman makes a call to his lawyer to
      confess his crimes only for it to be received as a joke and to learn that Paul Allen is alive and on vacation.
      This "twist" is often interpreted as a consequence of Bateman's psychosis, his life being a dream, him being out
      of touch with reality, etc.
      <br><br>

      I just don't agree and encourage you to think otherwise. I see Bateman's life as real in every normal sense,
      his actions have consequences, he affects the
      environment around him, but none of it matters. He is a meaningless entity. Nothing "happens" to <em>him</em>.
      The story is neither a tragedy nor a comedy, it is nothing. The ending
      is both real and not-real. But it definitely didn't matter. There is no significance to Patrick's
      violence because Patrick is nothing of significance. He can go on living his life but it isn't
      actually a life at all. The book is entirely meaningless as expertly exemplified by the extremely
      grotesque chapters that comprise the ever increasing descent into nothingness. The story doesn't
      climax it repeats, and it is just as shallow as it ever was.
      <br><br>
      As a representative of Wall-Street Capitalism, Patrick Bateman doesn't have intrinsic significance,
      he is amoral, and he does not lend itself to interesting interpretation. Audiences err when they see American
      Psycho as a <em>character piece</em>, or an adventurous thriller. It is a story about nothing. The violence
      doesn't matter any more than business cards matter.
      <br><br>
      I hope to outline this point with a
      few pieces of evidence.
        <br><br>
       <b>Drug Use:</b> The drug use in American Psycho is interesting for its stark contrast with the
      romanticization of drugs from the 60s and 70s. Rather than portraying drugs as a pathway to a kind of
      enlightenment, Patrick Batemans sees them as a means to an end. He needs them to get through work,
      stave off a hangover (from alcohol which was necessary to be in the NY scene), have a good workout, enjoy time
      with his significant other. I highly doubt the author intended it this way, but it highlights the vacuousness of
      material or substantive pleasures in a hilarious manner. Drugs specifically designed to control your emotions
      are only used to maintain a version of yourself to others (Bateman's whole being).
      <br><br>
      Drugs are the reference point for Bateman's feelings and emotions, as he has no internal soul for them to
      stem from. Even in the face of extreme, life-defining acts of violence - Bateman can only metaphorically
      speak of drug highs to express himself.
      <br><br>
      <em>
       [After tormenting a homeless man] Then I turn to the barking dog and when I get up, stomp on its
       front legs while it's crouched down ready to jump at me, its fangs bared, immediately shattering
       the bones in both its legs, and it falls on its side squeaking in pain, front paws sticking up in the
       air at an obscene, satisfying angle. I can't help but start laughing and I linger at the scene,
       amused by this tableau. When I spot an approaching taxi, I slowly walk away.
       <br>
       Afterwards, two blocks west, I feel heady, ravenous, pumped up, as if I'd just
       worked out and endorphins are flooding my nervous system, or just embraced that first line of cocaine,
       inhaled the first puff of a fine cigar, sipped that first glass of Cristal. I'm starving and I need
       something to eat, but I don't want to stop by Nell's, though I'm within walking distance and Indochine
       seems an unlikely place for a celebratory drink. So I decide to go somewhere Al would go, the McDonald's
       in Union Square. Standing in the line, I order a vanilla milk shake ("Extra-thick," I warn the guy, who
       just shakes his head and flips on the machine) and take it to a table up front, where Al would probably
       sit, my jacket, and its sleeves, lightly spattered with flecks of his blood. Two waitresses from the Cat
       Club walk in after me and sit in the booth across from mine, both smiling flirtatiously. I play it cool
       and ignore them. An old, crazy woman, wrinkled, chain-smoking, sits near us, nodding at no one.
       <br><br>
      </em>
       <b>Women/Misogyny:</b> Women are objectified and used as sexual receptors and / or a symbol of status for
      Bateman. The progression of the relationship to engagement/marriage is necessary only so far as it helps them
      with respect to their social circle. Bateman frequently refers to women as "hardbodies" as he would
      never look at them any deeper than that (he can't since he isn't any deeper himself). He treats prostitutes as
      sex robots that he only fucks to exemplify his capabilities. The most significant sexual attraction
      he has is to himself, as he stares at himself and flexes in the mirror while fucking a prostitute from behind.
      <br><br>

              position="right" size="30%">
      </captioned-image>
      Like drugs, women are not romanticized and used as a means to an end. Unlike drugs, the end isn't a pleasure but a
      validation. Bateman must constantly demonstrate his worth because he has no "being" to ground himself in. He has
      no emotions, and no opinion of himself. His sex is not romantic or pleasurable, it is best described as a
      valueless insertion of genitalia that reinforces himself to others.
      <br><br>
      <b>Art and Advertisements:</b> Novels and movies are types of art, American Psycho is both a novel and movie,
      making it a work of art (Logic). However, the portrayal of art in American Psycho is the biggest, boldest
      arrow pointing to a shallow, meaningless philosophy expressed by it. Despite always listening to music and renting
      video tapes, Patrick Bateman never comments on them with any depth. He doesn't say how the music makes *him* feel,
      but rather how the music *is*. He gives generic, uncontroversial analysis of
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ruw9fsh3PNY" target="_blank">Huey Lewis and the News</a>,
      Phil Collins, and more but never relates the music to his life or his emotions (like, you know, real people).
      <br><br>
      The closest we get to a penetrating piece of art for Bateman follows:
      <br><br>
      <em>
       But when I sit down something strange on the stage catched my eye. Bono has
       now moved across the stage, following me to my seat, and he's staring into my eyes, kneeling at the
       edge of the stage, wearing black jeans (maybe Gitano), sandals, a leather vest with no shirt
       beneath it. His body is white, covered with sweat, and it's not worked out enough, there's no
       muscle tone and what definition there might be is covered beneath a paltry amount of chest hair.
       He has a cowboy hat on and his hair is pulled back into a ponytail and he's moaning some dirge -
       I catch the lyrics "A hero is an insect in this world" - and he has a faint, barely noticeable but
       nonetheless intense smirk on his face and it grows, spreading across it confidently, and while his
       eyes blaze, the backdrop of the stage turns read and suddenly I get this tremendous surge of feeling,
       this rush of knowledge, and I can see into Bono's heart and my own beats faster because of this and I
       realize that I'm receiving a message of some kind from the singer. It hits me that we have something
       in common, that we share a bond, and it's not impossible to believe that an invisible cord attached to
       Bono has now encircled me and now the audience disappears and the music slows down, gets softer, and it's
       just Bono onstage - the stadium's deserted, the band fades away - and the message, his message, once
       vague, now gets more powerful and he's nodding at me and I'm nodding back, everything getting clearer, my
       body alive and burning on fire, and from nowhere a flash of white and blinding light envelopes me and I
       hear it, can actually feel, can even make out the letters of the message hovering above Bono's head in
       orange wavy letters: "I... am... the... devil... and I am... just... like... you...
      </em>
      <br><br>
      You, as a viewer, should interpret American Psycho in the way Patrick Bateman interprets 80s pop music. "Christian
      Bale looks very good while he is killing a cat", "The camera angle during the slaughter of prostitutes is very
      tasteful". You should not be extracting "reality" from it, or looking for a moral lesson, or seeing it as a
      period piece. It is nothing, just ink on paper or lights on a screen.
      <br><br>
      <b>Still Don't Believe Me?:</b> For a final straw, to prevent you from looking into this work
      more than you should. To stop you from thinking, "Man, is American Psycho a metaphor for insanity or
      mental illness?". To make sure you realize, all of Bateman's live is insignificant, meaningless, and unnecessary to
      interpret. I will lend you Bateman's explicit admission and agreement with me.
      <br><br>
      <em>
       "And I just can't..." She stops, frustrated. "I can't pretend these feelings don't
       exist, can I?"
           "Shhh..."
       .... there is an idea of Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only
       an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel
       flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am
       not there. It is hard for me to make sense of any given level. Myself is fabricated, an aberration.
       I am a non-contingent human being. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes
       deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at
       Harvard) if they ever did exist. There are no ore barriers to cross. All I have in common with the
       uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter
       indifference toward it, I have now surpassed. I still, though, hold on to the one
       single bleak truth: no one is safe, nothing is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of human
       behavior must be assumed to have some validity. Is evil something you are? Or is it something you
       do? My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact I want my
       pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this - and I have,
       countless times, in just about every act I've committed - and coming face-to-face with these truths,
       there is no catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be
       extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession
       has meant nothing. <br><br>
          I'm asking Jean, "How many people in this world are like me?" <br><br>
         She pauses, carefully answers, "I don't ... think anyone?" She's guessing. <br><br>
         "Let me rephrase the ques- Wait, how does my hair look?" I ask, interrupting myself. <br>
         "Uh, fine." <br>
      </em>
      <br>
     While one may be tempted to label this writing style a "stream of consciousness" it is actually more poignant
     and emblematic of the essence of the story - that Bateman and capitalism are vacuous entities.
