        <h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde</h2>
        <hr>
         <b>Preface:</b> Set in the late 19th century in Victorian England, The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only novel
      written by the quotable Oscar Wilde and illustrates his philosophy of 'aestheticism'. The movement sought to
      create art for art's sake as expressed in the preface to the book in Mr. Wilde's own words:
         <br><br>
         <em>
           "All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who
           read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity
           of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree the
           artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not
           admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite
           useless."
         </em>
         <br><br>
          This is opposed to artistic movements that see art as an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream" target = "_blank">expression of an idea</a>, a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(Picasso)" target = "_blank">description of the world</a>, as a
      <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ceiling_of_St_Peter%27s_Basilica.jpg" target = "_blank">symbol
        of transcendent wisdom</a>, a
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=trippy+art&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj55ZuB6qffAhUM0YMKHQShDSUQ_AUIDigB&biw=1853&bih=950" target = "_blank">
      vehicle to escape the banalities of existence</a>,  or as an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster" target = "_blank">element of persuasion</a>.
      Interestingly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUW7LiZA-iA" target="_blank">Fantasia</a> outlines a similar taxonomy
      of art and begins the movie with a work of Wilde's aestheticism, though I don't know for sure if the writer was
      directly inspired by Wilde.
      <br><br>
      A contradiction immediately results when you flip past the preface outlining aestheticism: Is this work a means
      to promote aestheticism, thus contradicting it? Or does it not connect to anything, including aestheticism,
      implying I can interpret it in a different way? Is it even possible to make art for art's sake as aestheticism
      believes? This contradiction is by design as Oscar Wilde did not want a clear cut intention to be
      interpreted from his work just like a clear cut moral message is not to be drawn from it either.
      <br><br>
      Going forward, I see the book as a work of cynicism or criticism. It is primarily a reaction against a
      culture rather than a canonical work to initiate a movement. It is worth noting that Oscar Wilde was gay,
      prosecuted for sodomy, and existed in a period of serious moral conflict between changing philosophical
      movements, geopolitical movements, religious movements, and literary/artistic movements. <em>The Picture of
      Dorian Gray</em> responds to this time period by saying, "I don't believe in any of your shit but I can still
      write a great moral novel".
      <br><br>
      <b>Summary:</b> The story centers around three main characters: Dorian Gray, Lord Henry, and Basil.
      Dorian Gray, the protagonist, has a tragic past consisting of dead parents but exists today as a proud member
      of the upper class with a devastatingly handsome face. Lord Henry is a friend of Dorian's, clearly in love with
      him romantically, and espouses an extremely hedonistic moral system - live your life for the individual and fuck
      the rest. Basically a more honest version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand" target = "_blank">
      Ayn Rand</a>'s shitty philosophy. Basil is an artist, also super in love with Dorian, and the general tempering
      force or voice for 'normalcy' in the novel.
      <br>

      <br><br>
      Shortly after the novel begins, Basil paints a picture of Dorian Gray that 'perfectly captures his beauty'
      (The book has explicit homosexual references but no sex which makes it super awkward at times). Simultaneously,
      Lord Henry influences Dorian's worldview by outlining a selfish, insular, and individualistic philosophy that
      includes the exaltation of Dorian's own beauty. Dorian wishes his beauty would be preserved forever leading to
      a cheesy magical scene where his 'age' gets transferred to the painting instead of his face.
      <br><br>
      To illustrate his adoption of Lord Henry's hedonism and parallel loss of his soul, Dorian Gray visits a local
      theatre where he instantly falls in love with an actress, Sibyl Vane, then subsequently dumps her ass when
      she embarrasses him in front of his friends. He regrets it and seeks forgiveness only to find that she killed
      herself. This happens in the course of what seems like a week: fall in love with actress, get engaged, take
      your friends to her show, she sucks, dump her, regret it, she kills herself. The total chaos of the affair
      represents his emotionally guided chaotic life that is in clear need of refinement via Lord Henry. What's
      more, the picture Basil painted of Dorian has noticeable blemish on it symbolizing the evil Dorian committed at
      the sacrifice of his soul. Given the horribleness of existence that Dorian has experienced (dead parents, his
      lover killed herself due to his reaction) he is clearly relieved to find an outlet to take the burden of evil
      off his shoulders. A scapegoat.
      <br><br>
      The break up between Dorian and Sibyl literally made me laugh out loud due to Oscar Wilde's remarkable writing
      ability. Get a load of it:
      <br><br>
      <em>
        "You have killed my love! You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't even stir my curiosity. You simply
        produce no effect. I loved you because you were marvelous, because you had genius and gave shape and
        substance to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid. My God! How mad
        I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never
        think of you. I will never mention your name. You don't know what you were to me, once. Why, once... Oh, I
        can't bear to think of it! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life."
      </em>
      <br><br>
      Brutal. Anyways, after the suicide the interlude of the novel progresses with Dorian studying a French
      novel given to him by Lord Henry that is not-so-subtly described as morally poisonous. He continues to have
      a series of 'experiences' over the next 18 years that continue to poison his soul. His old friend Basil visits
      to stage an intervention as Dorian is at major risk of losing any hope of a decent social standing if he
      continues down this path. Obviously resistant to his suggestion, Dorian shows Basil the portrait that he
      kept hidden in the attic with a face that is now horribly disfigured to reflect Dorian's decent into
      debauchery. Basil protests, and Dorian straight up stabs him to death. Then he blackmails his other friend,
      a chemist, to dispose of the body who then ends up killing himself in guilt.
      <br><br>
      Dorian continues to an opium den and is nearly murdered by Sibyl Vane's brother James who is later accidentally
      killed in a hunting accident. An attempt to reform by Dorian is rebuffed by Lord Henry ensuring him that no
      book corrupted him, as art is at best a mirror of one's own self. With so much blood on his hands (e.g. Sibyl,
      Basil, the chemist, James), Dorian returns to the portrait with hopes that it will improve in appearance due
      to some recent 'good' acts. However, the painting is even worse due to his self-interested motivation
      to improve. In a last ditch effort, Dorian slashes it with the knife he used to murder Basil. The painting is
      restored while Dorian lies dead - completing the self-destruction of his soul.

      <b>Morality of Self-Interest:</b> The question of, 'How ought I direct my life?' is investigated by negation.
      Namely, systems of belief centered around self-interest, rationality, and complete altruism are outlined as
      containing unforeseen consequences or inherent contradictions. Oscar Wilde adopts a technique I love in
      literature where the reader is able to 'try out' certain systems of belief through a character experiencing
      events that serve as a 'moral lesson' from author to reader. In this work, the attempts to 'rationally'
      operate morally is illustrated to be so subjective, contradictory, and counter-productive that it isn't a moral
      system at all.
      <br><br>
      Throughout the novel, Lord Henry represents a self-interested or hedonistic morality and consistently impresses
      it upon Dorian Gray:
      <br><br>
      <em>
        "There is no such thing as good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral - immoral from the scientific
        point of view. Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural
        thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such
        things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of someone else's music, an actor of a part that has not
        been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what
        each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all
        duties, the duty that one owes to one's self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe
        the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never
        really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals; the terror of god, which is the secret
        of religion - these are the two things that govern us. And yet, I believe that if one man were to live
        out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression, to every thought, reality
        to every dream - I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all
        the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal."
      </em>
      <br><br>
      The above quote makes it clear that a self-interested morality isn't self-interested at all - Lord Henry
      implies that his ultimate goal of an 'Hellenic Ideal' (everyone will be more 'reasonable' and, presumably, more 
      gay) is good not just for himself, but for society as a whole. A collection of people fulfilling 'their self' is 
      a romantic foundation implemented through reason. Accordingly, we all have a passion for our own self-preservation 
      that Lord Henry wishes we would take more seriously. But what are those 'romantic' foundations? Are they stable
      or shifting? They are elaborated later when Lord Henry seeks to console Dorian Gray after his break-up with 
      Sibyl Vane. Quote,
      <br>
      <img :src="getImgUrl('greek_gay.jpg')" alt="Greeks Gay" width="25%">
      <br><br>
      <em>
        "My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call
        their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.
        Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession
        of failure. Faithfulness! I must analyze it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many
        things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up."
      </em>
      <br><br>
      Monogamy amirite!? This as a pathetic attempt at a foundational justification for his self-interested morality via
      an appeal to nature or 'common sense'. "We all do it" according to Lord Henry (we don't). Your lack of selfishness 
      is nothing more than a character flaw we should disband in order to get to where we ought to go, 'The Hellenic
      Ideal'. This narrative structure of morality with a beginning connected to an end goal via some moral
      methodology is ubiquitous across belief systems. In this case, the astute reader ought to dismiss such
      a short-sighted belief system due its incoherency and litany of contradictions (self-interest so that
      society will improve? Indulge our emotions related to selfishness but not loyalty?). Instead, Dorian
      pursues it further with his study of the 'yellow French book' from Lord Henry during the 18 year interlude.
      Afterwards, the contradictions compound when Dorian Gray is philosophizing with Gladys:
      <br><br>
      <em>
        G: "I believe in the race." [race as in the pursuit, not ethnicity]<br>
        D: "It represents the survival of the pushing."<br>
        "It has development"<br>
        "Decay fascinates me more."<br>
        "What of Art?"<br>
        "Is is a malady." <br>
        "Love?" <br>
        "An illusion." <br>
        "Religion?" <br>
        "The fashionable substitute for Belief."<br>
        "You are a sceptic."<br>
        "Never! Scepticism is the beginning of Faith." <br>
        "What are you?" <br>
        "To define is to limit." <br>
        "Give me a clue." <br>
        "Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth."<br>
        "You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else."<br>
      </em><br>
      Gladys recognizes the incoherency in a short conversation yet Dorian Gray remains steadfast. At this point,
      he has consistently sacrificed his soul or 'self' in his pursuit of 'self-interest' making the conversation
      with Gladys a shallow attempt to dig deeper into what he believes. As the novel evolves, it is demonstrated
      that a moral system of self-interest results in an erosion of the soul and a pathetic agent acting in the world.
      Lord Henry, the avatar of hedonism, is still childishly afraid of the most obvious feature of human life - death:
      <br><br>
      <em>
        "If he is dead, I don't want to think about him. Death is the only thing that terrifies me, I hate it.
        One can survive anything nowadays except that."
      </em>
      <br><br>
      And here we have the nail in the coffin for his hedonistic self-interest. The pathetic 'lord' can't even
      face death more courageously than a young child despite his faithful adherence to his vacuous philosophy.
      Oscar Wilde and I are in complete agreement that it ought to be dismissed wholesale.
      <br><br>
      <b>Morality of the Transcendent:</b> Lord Henry's views are contrasted with the thesis of aestheticism and
      the beliefs of Basil, the painter. Rather than self interest, humans strive for something greater than themselves -
      they create art for the sake of art or they try to capture the beauty of the world for the sake of beauty.
      Emotions are a guide to moral acts, not a foundation. Reason is a tool, but not <em>the</em> tool. It is much
      closer to what we would call a 'religious' perspective where the agent would act for God for the sake of God
      rather than for their own entry into heaven. Basil is appalled by Dorian's flippant dismissal of his emotions
      guiding his actions:
      <br><br>
      <em>
        "It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is a master of himself can
        end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want
        to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."
      </em>
      <br><br>
      Basil, in contrast, would see emotions as an important guide to morality and the proper way of being. They
      signal when the trajectory is off and should not be tuned like a dial with rationality. It is emotions that
      let Basil understand beauty and drive his love for Dorian in the first place - the two components that yield
      his masterpiece, the portrait of Dorian.
      <br><br>
      Rather than an affirmative canonical piece for the morality of the transcendent, <em>The Picture of Dorian
      Gray</em> only touches on it to contrast it with Lord Henry and Dorian's hedonism. As stated in the preface,
      it is inherently contradictory to write a novel or create a piece of art for the sake of 'art' (transcendent)
      as the novel or piece of art will undoubtedly serve other interests including the author's.
      <br><br>
      <b>Moral Lesson:</b> Like ancient fables, I see <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> as an educational lesson
      in morality, or a way to live. Self-interest is a dead end that systematically erodes the agent's soul (or self) 
      rather than strengthening it. Strive for the transcendent or good for goodness's sake instead. The book won't tell 
      you how to do it, but it will eloquently and humorously illustrate what failure looks like and why you should
      avoid the temptation of self-interest. The effect of evil is similar to depictions of sin throughout
      Christian culture as a systematic erosion of the soul and evacuation of your 'being' (see Tolkien's
      <a href="https://screenrant.com/lotr-facts-orcs-movies-leave-out/">Orcs</a>). The end result is
      hell where there is nothing. No soul, no beauty, no goals, no worth as evidenced by Dorian stabbing his
      soul in the end of the novel.
      <br><br>
      <b>Romance:</b> Homosexuality is palpable throughout the book. Oscar Wilde was publicly prosecuted for sodomy
      in his home country and this book was banned or censored for much of the 100 years after its publication.
      References to love of male beauty, the importance of male-male relationships, and the glorification of
      "Hellenism" (the Greeks were super gay) are routinely interpreted as connections to homosexuality. In contrast,
      the relationships between males and females in the book are incredibly toxic, obsessive, shallow, and indulgent.
      There are clear parallels with other themes as the value of 'love' for 'love's sake' rather than for self-interest.
      Male-male love is for love, male-female love is for lust, self-interest, or cultural conformity.
      <br>

      <br><br>
      The topic is done well, but at times it is super awkward with how in love the men are with each other.
      I mean, we're talking two dudes gushing over each other's beauty without ever having sex (explicitly).
      It would be preferable to me if they just banged it out and got on with the moral philosophizing. But that
      is likely a broader contempt I have for romance in novels, it always appears as too cartoon-ish or melodramatic
      for my taste (Anna Karenina is the exception to this rule).
      <br><br>
      <b>Conclusion:</b> <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> stands out for its dark undertones and fantastic writing.
      It is a wonderful example of evil compounding due to the excesses of rationality and the stifling of emotions.
      Unfortunately, it doesn't address the much harder challenge of affirming a moral belief system but rather negates
      a somewhat cartoonish version of self-interested rationality. But it does accomplish this refutation with style
      and cogency through Oscar Wilde's great writing. Definitely recommend.
