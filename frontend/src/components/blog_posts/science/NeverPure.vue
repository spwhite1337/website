    <h2><b>Never Pure:</b> <em>Historical Studies of Science as if It Was Produced by People with Bodies, Situated in Time, Space, Culture, and Society, and Struggling for Credibility and Authority</em> by Steven Shapin</h2>
    <hr>
     I love Science, I studied it for a decade of my prime years and utilize it for my livelihood. I also believe it is seriously overrated in 2018 America. Steven Shapin's work is a great antidote to widespread misappropriations of science one can witness including:
     <ul>
       <li>
        (i) The Naturalistic Fallacy in its many forms. Most obviously when the "natural" structure of society is prescribed and justified with evolution.
       </li>
       <li>
        (ii) "Bayesian Reasoning" or "Scientific Methods" to morally optimize our utility (whatever that is) based off some metric (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox" target = "_blank">whatever that is</a>) in accordance with "science".
       </li>
       <li>
        (iii) When "science" the object or the institution is used as a substitute for truth, objectivity, credibility, authority, etc.
       </li>
       <li>
        (iv) The vast majority of nutritionists.
       </li>
       <li>
        (v) Whenever science (i.e. a physical description of the universe) is referenced during discussions of metaphysics (descriptions about said physical description) popularized by atheist vs. theist debates.
       </li>
     </ul>
     Steven Shapin demonstrates this with a strong thesis that investigates historical eras and moments in science by emphasizing the human element of the project. He does this intentionally and transparently with nods to the approach's limitations. There is no mention of the impersonal aspect of empirical adjudication of hypotheses, or the iconoclastic characters that disrupt institutions propelled by their scientific acumen. In order to write a book on such a big topic some things needed to be left out and, given his transparency, this can be easily forgiven.

     The work, "Never Pure", outlines this thesis in a series of (largely) stand-alone essays. My favorite essays are summarized in this post along with their highlights and my interpretation. I'll conclude with my views on where this leaves science and its role in modern America.
     <br><br>
     <b>Pro-Science and Anti-Science:</b> Before one pokes at sacred foundations of a society, it is essential to outline your terms of critique to belay the inevitable triggered response of, "What, you think the moon is just gonna fall to earth soon? Why don't you jump off a cliff if you don't believe in gravity?". This is right in Shapin's wheelhouse (a good chunk of his career is scientific heresy) so I will only present a few beliefs here that outline how one can be "anti-science":
     <ul>
       <li>
         Science happens within historical time and place, not outside of it. And in turn has a spatio-temporal dependency.
       </li>
       <li>
         Science is not one, unified, and indivisible. But many, diverse, and disunified.
       </li>
       <li>
         There is no stable, coherent scientific method nor is there scientific genius. Problems are identified collectively from interactions between the institution of science and the lay-public (or, in modern times, industry and the government) then solutions are 'found' when the problem dissolves.
       </li>
       <li>
         Science is not pure thought but that it is <em>practice</em>, that the hand is as important as the head, or even that the head follows the hand.
       </li>
     </ul>
     It is also important to highlight the non-uniqueness of physical-metaphysical connections that are claimed by the umbrella of "science". Does science tell us what is real? Or do we decide what is real then describe it scientifically? Is the scientific methodology exhaustive in this domain, or are other tools necessary? Consider the following quotes by famous scientists on the metaphysical implications of the model of the universe stemming from the scientific institution:

        </em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Continued research will fail to converge at a stable metaphysical relationship with science. If a litany of quotes don't convince you, then consider the entire field of metaphysics in philosophy - do you think this is redundant with 'science'? Do you think Aristotle was mistaken when he wrote "Metaphysics" after physics? Of course not, there is indeed a distinction and it is indeed important.
    <br><br>
    In truth, it is silly to collapse science and metaphysics into the same domain just as it is silly for <a href="https://creationmuseum.org/" target= "_blank">Creationists</a> to separate them entirely. They are connected in a complicated fashion that modern institutions cannot stably define. I would encourage you to look elsewhere.

   <br><br>
   <b>Places of Science:</b> The signage surrounding scientific laboratories is far from welcoming and far from new. This kind of isolation is justified on grounds of 'data integrity' (also safety, etc.).
   Steven Shapin diligently illustrates just what the hell this kind of integrity means and how the concept has morphed and evolved over time. He notes that human psychology is skeptically biased to unintuitive claims made from within its own environment. "You must not be seeing what I'm seeing" or "I know as good as you do and you're full of shit." This makes "doing science" outside of a "scientific lab" a contradiction. Science cannot be performed in the irrational world of lay folk, it requires a sober mind in a sober environment to make 'objective' claims to truth. <em>(The scientific lab is so ingrained in today's society it is difficult to imagine one without. The closest example I can imagine is a kind of internet blogger or youtuber promising they took great care in their scientific experiments they performed in their basement.)</em>
   <br><br>
   Before the infrastructure was in place, experimental work was pioneered by wealthy philosophers or an agreement between philosophers and patrons. It generally took place at the philosopher's personal estate. Shapin gives us a wonderful case study of one of my favorite enlightenment philosophers, Robert Boyle. An Irishman, he laid the foundations of chemistry and empirical science while fighting for and outlining the credibility of such an endeavor. Most importantly, Boyle and contemporaries like Bacon strongly argued <em>against</em> the solitude and isolated nature of philosophical findings. They resisted natural philosophy being defined by a caste of unreachable "priests of nature" tapping into natural truths. Instead, they desired public displays and social acceptance of empirical findings on their own grounds. They both saw the project as a fundamentally religious one making the isolation of scientists the downside, not the priestly aspect, because the truths of God's creation ought to be disseminated like the truths of scripture.
   <br><br>
   The modern laboratory and other constructed places of science are easy to see but harder to trace historically. Shapin connects the separation of scientific practice from the public to the broader separation of thinkers from society going back to antiquity. Think of Jesus wandering in the desert alone before he sees God, St. Paul converting on the Road Damascus, Joseph Smith alone in Upstate New York, Led Zeppelin writing songs in the rural English countryside at Bron-Yr-Aur, professors taking sabbaticals to write a book, the Twitter CEO taking meditation retreats to the East, Darwin on the Galapagos Islands, Dexter's laboratory (yes, the cartoon) outside the view of his parent's house. In order to truly tap into the "truths" of the natural world one must untie themselves from the bounds of human society and its associated biases to really understand 'how it all works'. This transcendent action begets transcendent knowledge, a feature that holds true for scientists who must find pristine places of work that barricade themselves both physically and mentally from the status quo. Ultimately, this trend morphed into the modern laboratories we have today. Private investigation and public dissemination of natural knowledge.
   <br><br>
   Naturally, the historical participation in the scientific enterprise required access to such seclusion or your results or findings would not achieve the necessary credibility. It was the loosening of this restriction, beginning with Boyle and Bacon in the 16th century, that lead to the huge amounts of scientific participation seen today. They pushed for public displays, clear communication, and even reproducibility! Without their efforts we would be left with a secluded class that had exclusive access to natural truths. In this light, contemporary laments about the 'lack of scientific knowledge' in society deserve nothing but ridicule when placed in the proper historical context.
   <br><br>
   <b>People of Science:</b> The leaders of "science" and the enlightenment had their own ideas about who was doing the science for their plan for humanity. Much of their vision was inspired by criticisms of the Scholastic era with its clergyman and scholars living lives of seclusion and isolation from the public (see section above). In a sense, they were <em>too</em> isolated to find <em>relevant</em> truths. Here Shapin lays out the evolution of the "scholar and the gentleman" as a proper proponent of the experimental push for a more 'democratic' scientific progression.
   <br><br>
   The scholar is studious, modest, and private - the gentleman is charismatic, wealthy, and public. The blending of these two personas was, in Boyle's view, important for the expansion of science's credibility among the public and the political leaders of the time. Of course, this scientist must be tempered by Christians virtues as Boyle outlined very seriously:<br><br>
   <ul>
     <li>
       First, such a man was said to be personally uninterested in the material rewards that might flow from genuine natural philosphy.
     </li>
     <li>
       Second, he must be humble. Reading "God's Book of Nature" engendered in the Christian virtuoso a "well-grounded docility servicable to religion".
     </li>
     <li>
       Third, the experimental philospher must be a man of honor to maintain the integrity of the project.
     </li>
     <li>
       Fourth, the experimental philosopher must be a devout Christian who identified his work as a form of religious practice. Boyle described experimental philosophers as 'priests of nature' with laboratories serving as places of 'divine worship'.
     </li>
   </ul>
   While strikingly different than how we view the 'ideal scientist' today. There is no doubt a pattern of criteria that transfers to modernity. Science is routinely rejected due to financial conflicts of interest ("true science" doesn't come from Monsanto, Big Pharma, or Big Oil). Science is routinely rejected on political grounds (racist science). Even within the Academy, science is dismissed when it comes from select institutions or select countries. There is clearly an 'ideal' scientist and corresponding affiliation that the public requires for credibility - it would be easier if we were more explicit about it like Boyle was.
   <br><br>
   Some might argue that the 'ideal' scientist would be fundamentally amoral. Pure objectivity. Spock from Star Trek. Nothing is off limits because science doesn't make moral judgments. This is a category mistake. Science, the descriptive model of the universe, does not contain moral values. But science, the institution or methodology, most certainty does. Behind every scientific experiment is an implication that we "ought" to be getting this knowledge. The knowledge cannot justify itself (if we're still talking about amoral descriptions), so it must be justified by something else - that something is the institution of science and the corresponding scientist.
   <br><br>
   The results are clearly in my favor, I can't identify a single scientific communicator who presents their results absent a moral message, but many who do:

   This is not a dig at the listed scientists, drawing a line between science and morality is impossible (Some astute readers may note that all those listed are male and most are white/jewish. But you probably understand that science is not amoral as represented by demographics.). It is importent to remember this distinction: the scientific model of the universe is amoral, the people and institutions who make it and the methodologies they utilize are anything but amoral.
   <br><br>
   As a final note, it is trendy to historically analyze scientific figures with an emphasis on their sexism. But it is important to distinguish (at least) two kinds of exclusion that arise in institutions: (i) explicit prevention of certain groups, and (ii) selection of people based on standards only certain people can possibly meet. The latter is far, far more common and harder to alter because doing so affects the credibility of the institution through its diminished admission selectivity. In fact, an institution that is both 'inclusive' and 'credible' is, in some ways, a contradiction...
   <br><br>
   <b>The Body of Science:</b> This is by far my favorite chapter because it connects the scientist's philosophy with their personal bodily care (health, nutrition, sleep, drink, smoking). Once credibility is earned, the natural philosopher is naturally questioned on 'how they do it' and the methods they use (if you can't guess from Shapin's themes) vary historically and culturally. If they're really good, they get asked about immortality (seriously).
   <br><br>
   Given the connection between diet/action in every ideology or religion documented - it should come as no surprise that experimental philosophy has its own associated habits and rituals related to diet and health. All of them through all time have all been backed by science (or the most credible source of knowledge of the natural world) and all of them enable the control of the material body with the mind in the same way experimental philosophy gains control of molecules once proper experimentation is complete. In order to credibly comment on the state of the material world one must be able to understand their own material body. Excesses of vice were not characteristic of the gentlemanly scholar, but rather an irrational brute. The exact balance between virtue and vice varied amongst thinkers with some demanding an ascetic ideal (Plato, Wittgenstein) while others believed moderation was yet another virtue to moderate.
   <br><br>
   <em>
     "That he did believe he had been in excess in his life a hundred times; which, considering his great age, did not amount to above once a year. When he did drink, he would drink to excess to have the benefit of vomiting, which he did easily... but he never was, nor could not endure to be, habitually a good fellow, i.e. to drink every day wine with company, which, though not to drunkeness, spoils the Brain." John Aubrey in his biography of Thomas Hobbes who blacked out and puked once a year like a bitch (I'm jk)
   </em>
   <br><br>
   I think the reason I like this section so much is because it's almost as if Shapin is analyzing me. I similarly think that "science" is done with nutrition and hasn't progressed much since the time of Rene Descartes who claimed,
   "By the age of 30 the man knows more about his body that the best physician." I also think moderation should be adopted in moderation. I also think my views are as correct as all the science I have participated in throughout my life. The problem with nutrition science is that people don't ask scientific questions that lead to scientific problems that science can 'dissolve'. Instead, people mask their personal problems in dietary or health problems that they hope science can save them from. As history shows, science is no source of salvation.
   <br><br>
   <b>Natural Science of Nature:</b> One of my favorite passages of this work is the relationship between "nature" and science and, specifically, how it relates to politics and/or social order.
   <br><br>
   <em>
     "There has always been, and there probably always will be, an intimate connection between how people recognize good knowledge and how they conceive a good society. The relationship is not one of mere analogy; it is constitutive. The making of reliable, objective, and robust knowledge -- that is, for us, <u>science</u> -- is accomplished by communities of expert human beings -- <u>scientists</u> -- and it can produce anything but distorted knowledge: not <u>science</u> but ideology or dogma or error. Verity and virtue march in lock-step through history, as do error and evil. The Republic of Science is modeled on the City of God." Steven Shapin, Intro to Chapter 4.

   One can replace the underlined phrases with those for the appropriate era (e.g. Theology, priests, God's Word for the Scholastic Era) or for the vision you have for society. These broad "appeals to nature" are not unique to scientists and, in fact, are a ubiquitous part of how we interact with our community, our society, and the world:<br><br>

Its principal precepts are expressed in the Decalogue. This law is called natural, not in reference to the nature of irrational beings, but because reason which decrees it properly belongs to human nature." - Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section 1, Chapter 3, 1955

      </em>
    </li>
   </ul>
  Appeals to nature are ubiquitous, I tried to get examples from a wide range of political theories including an anarchist like Chomsky, capitalists like Rockefeller, and communists like Stalin as to avoid singling out any point on the (multi-dimensional) spectrum. I can only be so sure, but I suspect the universality of "appeals to nature" is itself an offshoot of human nature. To elaborate, we identify ourselves and the communities we belong to as situated in a narrative structure with a beginning, middle, and end. Religions make their beginning most identifiable with their creation stories (etiologies). But non-religous examples include science incepted from the enlightenment (it isn't), or political pundits referencing a fictional version of historical figures (FDR, Lincoln). The end conclusion of the narrative is some kind of promise that is continually out of reach. E.g. "The enlightenment taught us reason, if we build a natural society on reason then we will get to a point where we are all super reasonable and good.". Other examples include the communist utopia, the coming of Jesus, material wealth for all, conquering the world, liberating the masses. The "middle", where we always reside and where we make appeals to nature, is the 'natural' progression from beginning to end. The authors of the above quotes don't appeal to nature in isolation, but to justify a means to implement a path to their envisioned goal. To be clear, this is my idea - not Steven Shapin's.
  <br><br>
  Always be wary when people support "Science backed policy" or "Evolution inspired politics" without independently outlining their end goals and inspirational beginnings.
  <br><br>
  <b>Concluding Remarks:</b> This book is a treat. It lifts the veil on some silly conceptions of science held by the broad public and also outlines the reasons for the pecularities of human institutions. The main value of the book stems from the elaboration of historical scientists' successes and the associated failures from extrapolating beyond those successes. Commonly referred to as the "Naturalistic Fallacy" or the inability for a descriptive model of the world to justify a prescriptive model is, was, and will remain an irresistible temptation for intellectuals of all stripes, institutions, and time periods. This is not to say a descriptive model is unimportant, but to properly bound its relevance to avoid false prophets and faulty moral reasoning.
  <br><br>
  Personally, I could listen to anecdotes about historical figures in science along with interpretations of their philosophies for a long, long time. Steven Shapin covers Rene Descarte, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke, and more throughout this work allowing one to deeply appreciate their effect on modernity and their role in expanding the knowledge of humanity.
