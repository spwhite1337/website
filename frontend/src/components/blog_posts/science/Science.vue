    <h2>How I Define Science</h2>
    <hr>
     <b>Short Version:</b> Science is a coherent and consistent model of the universe based on the application of rigid
    designators to objects and phenomena through a rational process constrained by empirical evidence and falsifiability.
    It is defined by its results we can obtain under these constraints, not the methods or institutions as those are
    contingent and ephemeral.
     <br>
    <br>
     <b>Background:</b> The ideas behind science and the context in which it resides simply cannot be completely
    decoupled from the broader development of knowledge and philosophy throughout history. It is hardly a 20th century
    phenomena much less an "enlightenment" one. The early roots of science can be found in all ancient cultures as they
    tried to make sense of the chaotic world around them. Most famously,
    the foundations of modern science were laid by the Ancient Greeks including Aristotle, Euclid, and Lucretius. They
    referred to "natural philosophy" as the investigation of the natural world (as opposed to the supernatural) and
    mainly pursued it through rational argumentation and logic. Their work was far different from the science we do
    today, largely due to their limited capabilities for scientific experimentation. In fact, this dichotomy is a
    useful probe to track the development of science as <em>the interplay between rational reasoning and the
    interpretation of information coming in from empirical evidence.</em>

     Historical debates on the origin of light are useful illustrations of science's genealogy. Back in the day, it
    wasn't so clear that "light" was emitted from objects like sun or fire and received by our eyes (Intromission
    Theory) but rather it was thought to be emitted from our own eyes like Cyclops from X-men and reflected back
    (Emission Theory). Emission theory, while debunked today, was defended by titans of ancient philosophy like Euclid
    and Ptolemy with a considerable amount of intellectual force behind it. For example, they could explain the
    superior night vision of cats by the clear
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_in_ancient_Egypt#/media/File:Egyptian_-_Statue_of_a_Seated_Cat_-_Walters_54403_-_Three_Quarter.jpg" target = "_blank">
        glow in their eyes</a> in the dark. They could also explain the similarities between fire, a fundamental
    element of the universe, and humans. Both could give off heat and light because they both stemmed from the same
    elemental constituents. Most religious or mystical folks connected this to the gods that enabled their eyes to work
    and incorporated it into their creation stories claiming humans and animals
     <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empedocles/#1" target = "_blank">were fundamentally connected to fire
     </a>. It likely inspired them to make "sacrifices" to fire and reap the benefits from said gods

        target = "_blank">(e.g. clays or materials)</a>.
     <br><br>
     Ibn Al-Haytham put an end to the emission theory of light and verified early ideas of intromission. To accomplish
    this, he first made a good argument (more or less all you needed at the time). But as a bonus, he introduced an
    early kind of empirical verification by combining work on human anatomy with his experiments on lenses and mirrors
    to show how unlikely and improbable it was for light to reflect off curved objects and manifest the images we see
    everyday. This early example of the interplay between rational argumentation and empirical investigation was
    systematically refined and amplified over the next millennium.

     While I'm presenting the rationalism/empiricism as a binary battle, it is more accurately a question of degrees.
    To illustrate, I ask you to consider the extremes:
     <ul>
       <li>Pure rationalism can get you far, but it presents multiple explanations for the same phenomena. This is best
           exemplified by the plurality of etiologies (creation stories) found in the world's religions.</li>
       <li>Pure empiricism is unambiguous but also very, very limited. One cannot even know what to look for without an
           <em>a priori</em> rational framework in place. Relying on evidence alone to justify evidence presents a
           circular argument and nothing useful.</li>
     </ul>
     The optimal interplay between the two results in science. We need some rationalized framework to get off the
    ground, but we use empirical evidence to inspire, verify, and stratify the spectrum of models that result.
     <br><br>
     <b>Modern Science:</b> More formally, the current scientific community maintains an essential constraint on models
    of the natural world - they must be falsifiable by experimental evidence. As a concrete example, if your rational
    model of human consciousness can explain contradictory human behaviors with the same motivation - it doesn't count
    as science. Similarly, if your "scientific" theory of economics explains contradictory phenomena with the same
    underlying class struggle - it not longer counts as science. These two examples stem from Sigmund Freud and Karl
    Marx who inspired the philosopher Karl Popper to articulate the value of falsifiability.
     <br><br>
     Every scientific model today has this constraint built in. Whether it's cancer metastasis, quantum field theory,
    electronics design, or turbulent fluid mechanics - they all are the "reigning champ" of their respective domains
    that can be falsified at any time should another model improve on their explanation of the underlying evidence.
     <br><br>
     <b>Consequences:</b> That all is relatively uncontroversial in the abstract but mapping it down to pragmatic
    applications leads to very bizarre stretches of the imagination, at least in my opinion. In early 21st century 
    America, I see far too much emphasis placed on rational side of this interplay. As science has progressed over the 
    years it has reached into new domains once considered out of reach such as the origin of the universe and the 
    human mind. I see this as a gross over-rationalization that is only taken seriously due to a lack of credibility in 
    the opposition.

    <br>
     Here are a few examples:<br><br>
     <ul>
       <li><u>Evolutionary psychology:</u> Human behavior has always perplexed philosophers and scientists alike
           because humans just aren't well described by deterministic, rationally grounded mechanisms. Psychologists
           and neuroscientists face a very difficult challenge: How we can rationally describe an irrational system?
           I'm not sure they can, at least not to the same degree we can describe, say, electronic devices. Eccentric
           thinkers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson" target = "_blank">Robin Hanson</a>
           describe human behavior as a mixture of signaling mechanisms. Which is fine, I suppose, but when exactly
           aren't we signalling? And who decides what that signal is? If the expert models say I'm buying a gun to
           overcome my masculine insecurities, but I say I'm doing it because it is fun to shoot popcans, who is
           correct? How can your high-level models ever reduce down to individual constituents of your domain? I need
           to see an answer to this question, or an admission of its limitation. This is an example of <em>rationally
           grounded models struggling to grasp irrational human behavior.</em> Also a nice of example of scientists
           insisting on their detachment of their object of study, even if it is their own self.</li>
       <li><u>Cosmology:</u> First of all, I wholeheartedly admit that the Big Bang is the best model we have for the
           origin of the universe. But how much evidence do we really have that the inflationary epoch lasted
           10<sup>-32</sup> seconds and increased the volume by about 10<sup>78</sup>? Something like the Cosmic
           Microwave Background is pretty far removed from "direct" evidence in my estimation. Again, I accept it is
           our best scientific explanation, but is it really better than saying, "We don't know"? If the standards
           for evidence are lowered to that which we can attain, then we run the risk of over rationalizing
           spectacularly when the attainable evidence is very limited in scope. <em>This is an example of the best
           theory stretching our cognition into areas not directly verifiable with empirical evidence.</em></li>
       <li><u>Aliens and the Origin of Life:</u> Extraterrestrial life has captured our imagination for decades and
           inspired laudable efforts in space exploration and astrobiology. However, we've yet to see any evidence
           for it. That doesn't mean it's not there, I guess. But that same logic applies to mole people under the
           earth or the Lost City of Atlantis. Nothing yet! But we can keep looking, I guess. We are stuck in this
           indeterminate state without a concrete idea of what we are even looking for. We know there is life on earth
           today, but we have no idea how it got here (abiogenesis has never been replicated in a laboratory setting).
           In my view, there is no point in continuing this search until the lower hanging fruit are grappled with.
           Our rational explanation for extraterrestrial life does not hold any water until we can outline the origin of
           life on earth and concretely outline a testable hypothesis for the existence of life outside it. Until then,
           we are just aimlessly poking around in the dark unscientifically. <em>This is an example of the best theory
           failing to surpass the proper default position of a skeptical indeterminism.</em> </li>
     </ul>
     <b>Limitations:</b> Science is a fantastic tool that has brought many advantages to
     living in modern society. But it is a tool that is only as good as the agent wielding it. I accept the reality of
    the scientific model of the universe, but not as a reality independent of the agents constructing it. Saul Kripke
    is arguably the most influential analytical philosopher of
    the 20th century who outlined a <a href="http://www.theotodman.com/Kripke_Naming.pdf" target = "_blank">beautiful
    causal theory of reference</a> for the naming of objects and phenomena. In this framework, we identify the reality
    of objects routinely. But we do so under the mediation of language. Some properties of objects are "necessarily
    true" meaning they are true in every possible world that object could exist in, or else it would not be that object.
    The results of science use these necessarily true properties or "rigid designators" to construct a model of the
    universe.
    <br>
    <captioned-image
          :image="getImgUrl('saul_kripke.jpg')" alt="Kripke" caption="Genius and Nerd, Saul Kripke"
          position="right" size="30%">
    </captioned-image>
    <br>
     For other properties like value, moral virtue, meaning, purpose, etc. the object can have different values in
    various circumstances making them contingent properties rather than rigid designators. As a result, any attempts
    to describe these properties scientifically falls flat right out of the gate. They are simply outside science's
    domain. It is like calculating the square root of -1 with the set of real integers - you can do it for an infinite
    amount of time but you'll never find what you're looking for.
     <br><br>
     <b>Summary:</b> Science is a very useful tool that describes reality in a valuable but limited way. The connection
    between our rational faculties and empirical interrogation yield a view of the universe that is precise but
    constrained by falsifiability and rigid necessity. The hardest aspect of science and the scientific method to
    universally define is the standard of empirical evidence that verifies a given rational explanation. To me,
    the answer ultimately boils down to morality and routinely varies with changing conventions.
     <br><br>
     Symbolically, science can be represented with a sponge. It will always have holes in the form of evidence gaps,
    unanswered questions, or questions it simply can't access making it bad candidate for a foundation of society or
    personal worldview, but a great tool for cleaning up existing structures and ideologies.
