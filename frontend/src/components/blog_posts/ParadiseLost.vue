    <h2>Paradise Lost, by John Milton</h2>
    <hr>
   <p>
     Paradise Lost is an epic poem by John Milton that has had reverberating influences on Christianity and Western society since its publication in 1667. Modern conceptions of hell, Satan/Lucifer, and angels can usually be connected directly to Milton's work. It is very difficult to read due to its poetic prose, so I had to read it in parallel with secondary sources that explained the story in plain English (<a href="http://www.paradiselost.org/lmg/Book-1.html" target = "_blank">Example</a>).
     <br><br>
     It is far too massive to tackle the whole thing, so instead I will highlight its relation to conspiratorial thinking - a pattern that is super relevant to navigating the internet and contemporary politics - and comment on the theological implications of Milton's depiction of Adam and Eve.
     <br><br>
     Works like Paradise Lost can really only be understood in a Christian context. If you approach them like "any other work of fiction" you'll lose sight of the insights people draw from the work and its affect on humanity's self-perception ("What does it all mean, man?!?").

     <b>Rough Summary:</b> The poem starts out depicting the Holy Spirit inspiring a story-teller to relay the tale of creation in an analogous fashion to greek muses inspiring poems like the Odyssey or the Illiad.

       "Of Man’s First Disobedience, and the Fruit <br>
        Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste  <br>
        Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, <br>
        With loss of Eden, till one greater Man <br>
        Restore us, and regain the blissful <br>
        Seat, Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top <br>
        Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire <br>
        That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen <br>
        Seed, In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth <br>
        Rose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill <br>
        Delight thee more, and Siloa’s Brook that flow’d <br>
        Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence <br>
        Invoke thy aid to my advent’rous Song, <br>
        That with no middle flight intends to soar <br>
        Above th’ Aonian Mount, while it pursues <br>
        Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhyme. <br>
                 (I.1–26)"

     From there, Lucifer is chilling in hell with an assortment of biblical demons reconvening after their defeat against the forces of heaven. Frustrated, he plans to undermine God's creation by corrupting it underhandedly rather than attacking it head on. He ventures out of hell by sweet-talking the guardians, Sin and Death, and disguises himself as a Cherub to learn the location of Eden from the angel Uriel and makes his way there disguised as an Eagle (or a generic large bird or something).
     <br><br>
     Satan morphs into a toad and approaches Adam and Eve in the garden to corrupt them. Meanwhile, God is spectating with a watchful eye and sends his angel Gabriel to lay down the hammer on that tricky Satan who bolts after God sends him a vision of golden scales of justice (Satan is the opposite of justice).

     Raphael enters the scene and gives Adam and Eve a bit of a pep talk after Satan infiltrated their dreams. Raphael relays warnings about Adam's inquistive nature, reminding him that God is the source of knowledge and there are some concepts beyond his reach. He also reminds Adam that his love for Eve is spiritual in nature, not lustful (even though they still have sex).
     <br><br>
     About a week after getting scurried away, Satan returns to Paradise and takes the form of a serpent. He corrupts Eve by coercing her to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. She does and frantically tells Adam who follows suit and eats in solidarity with Eve. Then later have sex out of animalistic lust.
     <br><br>
     Watching all along, God sends Jesus to put the situation back in order. Jesus punishes Satan and informs Adam and Eve that they will now experience Pain and Death as a consequence of their sin. Adam throws a fit and argues with Eve throwing blame at her and himself. Ultimately, they resolve to remain obedient to God to spite Satan despite the hardships they will inevitably face.
     <br><br>
     God hears their cries and sends Michael (Archangel) down to help them out. Michael shows Adam the future which is a retelling of the Old Testament full of suffering and death. Michael concludes the poem by showing Adam a vision of Christ's sacrifice which gives him hope to carry on outside of paradise.

     <em>
       "They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld <br>
        Of Paradise, so late their happy seat, <br>
        Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate <br>
        With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms: <br>
        Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon; <br>
        The world was all before them, where to choose <br>
        Their place of rest, and Providence their guide: <br>
        They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, <br>
        Through Eden took their solitary way."

     <b>Satan the Conspirator:</b> Focusing on Satan's plans, the poem starts with Satan's realization that he can never beat God and his army head on. He must instead underhandedly corrupt God's creation and win a game with rules he sets himself. Adam and Eve didn't have a chance because they were ultimately a tool for Satan's game.

     The accusation John Milton leverages at Satan is the same structure that all prophets leverage against their enemy, "You are evil and motivated by revenge. So you are just going to pursue your goal without any ethical restraints and must be stopped!". More commonly, this takes the form of worshipping idols or false gods - similar to 'playing by rules you're not supposed to play'. In Milton's vision, the evil behavior is a product of his evil nature rather than accidental intentions that spiral off into evilness.
     <br><br>
     It is important to note that Milton does not call Satan weak. In fact, Satan is constantly depicted as powerful and mighty:
     <br><br>
     <em>
       "Then with expanded wings he stears his flight <br>
        Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air <br>
        That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land <br>
        He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd <br>
        With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; <br>
        And such appear'd in hue, as when the force <br>
        Of subterranean wind transports a Hill <br>
        Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side <br>
        Of thundring Ætna, whose combustible <br>
        And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire, <br>
        Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, <br>
        And leave a singed bottom all involv'd <br>
        With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole <br>
        Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, <br>
        Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood <br>
        As Gods, and by thir own recover'd strength, <br>
        Not by the sufferance of supernal Power."
     </em>
     <br><br>
     The explicit depiction of Satan as evil by nature (and powerful) is not exactly accepted by the Catholic Church. There, evil does not exist in itself as all existence is a product of God and therefore good. However, Milton either disagreed with this theology or simplified it for use as a narrative device. The conniving, conspiracizing, underhanded Satan is in direct contrast to an honorable, just, and honest enemies found in other epics. The absolute power of these traits is too much for man alone, but trivial for God and/or Jesus to smite down.
     <br><br>
     If you look closely, you'll find this narrative structure all over contemporary society and especially in politics. Hillary Clinton was resentful from her loss to Obama so she cheated to beat Bernie Sanders and tried to undermine the 'rules' of democracy. Donald Trump colluded with Russia to manipulate the public and the Republicans gerrymandered districts to get elected. Those two examples illustrate the profound difficulty we have to decouple 'evil' from 'evil behavior'. In our eyes, an evil person can never do something good and evil behavior isn't enacted by good people. In contrast, John Milton works diligently to decouple these behaviors in his depiction of Adam and Eve. They betray God but not due to their intrinsic evil nature but due to their intrinsic shortcomings.
     <br><br>
     <b>Adam and Eve:</b> While the theological implications of Paradise Lost are far too much for me to swallow, the perspective he takes on Adam and Eve is worth a comment. They initially exist as effectively equals - sharing a blissful love in Paradise. Eve commits the first sin, but due to deception by Satan. Adam follows suit, but of his own volition.
     <br><br>
     This belief reflects the controversial portrayal of genders in Christianity. In essence, our differences are irrelevant before God but our roles in society manifest differently. Adam is created first implying his role is to be the 'face' or 'head' of the Garden as a leader in service of God. Eve is created from Adam implying she is in service to both Adam and God. Later on, this relationship is expanded to include Jesus in the hierarchy as well.
     <br><br>
     To say something like, "Men are above women" or "Adam is above Eve" is too reductionist. They are both nothing without each other but can combine in harmony to properly orient themselves in life. Alone, Eve fell victim to deception by Satan's exploitation of her vanity. Adam's presence could have (i) mitigated her vane concerns by expressing his love to her or (ii) fortified her integrity in the face of temptation. Similarly, with a weakened Eve, Adam loses site of his purpose and perspective. He eats of the tree to regain the solidarity he failed to maintain.

          "Not equal, as their sex not equal seem’d; <br>
          For contemplation hee and valor form’d,<br>
          For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,<br>
          Hee for God only, shee for God in him:<br>
          His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar’d <br>
          Absolute rule; and Hyacinthine Locks <br>

          Her unadorned golden tresses wore <br>
          Dishevell’d, but in wanton ringlets wav’d <br>
          As the Vine curls her tendrils, which impli’d <br>

          And by her yielded, by him best receiv’d, <br>
          Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, <br>
          And sweet reluctant amorous delay. " <br>
         (IV.295–311)
     </em>
     <br><br>
     When mapped to specifics, the gender relationship in Christianity is difficult to square with Modernity. For example, Adam is the main conduit of insight from Angels and God as opposed to God talking to them both - implying she doesn't 'need to know'. The core lesson from pre-modernity is that maintaining a connection between men and women requires a shared identity where each can individually complement for the greater pair. How this will look going forward is far beyond me - but it is worthwhile to investigate 'sexist' philosophies in order to understand their structure before they are demolished.
