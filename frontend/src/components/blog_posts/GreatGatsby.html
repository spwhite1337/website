        Years back, I accepted an invitation to join a rec soccer team with a bunch of people that didn't know me and didn't
        know each other outside of Tuesday nights from 7-8pm. One gentleman, John from England, didn't take too kindly to
        my playing style despite me scoring >2 goals a game and our team consistently making it to the semi-finals (In
        his defense, I tend to hog the ball. In my defense, his shot was terrible.). After one session, we went out for
        post-game beers and he revealed he was an English major. Someone asked about his favorite American book and he
        said, "The Great Gatsby". And I jokingly replied, "Did that inspire you to move to America and persue the
        American Dream?" and he said something like, "Well that's the high school reading of the novel, as a metaphor
        for the American dream, but not how I see it."

        And in typical "I'm from Europe and think I know how to play football even though this kid from Iowa is way
        better than me and also I read books more intelligently than all of you" fashion he never revealed his "advanced"
        interpretation. This post is my attempt to match it.

        <b>Character Summary:</b> Even though it's nearly universally read in American schools I don't have one moment
        of memory
        corresponding to The Great Gatsby from High School so a quick summary is in order. The protagonist, Nick
        Carraway moves from the Midwest to New York in the early 1900s. There he meets three important characters:
        Tom Buchanan, his cousin Daisy Buchanan, and the titular Gatsby. All wealthy members of the NY elite, they
        ostensibly live the American Dream with piles of wealth, new cars, and nice mansions.
        <br><br>
        Tom is a former athlete, muscular, and arrogant. He is a classic scientific racist from the early 20th century
        and reeks of insecurity despite his good looks, wealth, and beautiful wife. Almost as if he struggles to
        justify the quality of his life because he is a shitty person (IMO, the clear intent here).
        <br><br>
        <em>
            I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.
        <br><br>
        “Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about
            things. Have you read ‘The Rise of the Colored Empires’ by this man Goddard?”
        <br><br>
        “Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.
        <br><br>
        “Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will
            be — will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”
        <br><br>
        “Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books
            with long words in them. What was that word we ——”
        <br><br>
        “Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out
            the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will
            have control of things.”
        <br><br>
        “We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.
        <br><br>
        “You ought to live in California —” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.
        <br><br>
        “This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and ——” After an infinitesimal hesitation he
            included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “— And we’ve produced all the things that go
            to make civilization — oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”
        <br><br>
        </em>
        Tom is married to Daisy but cheats on her routinely, specifically with a woman named Myrtle from the poorer
        side of town.
        <br><br>
        Daisy Buchanan is Nick's cousin, the wife of Tom, and the eternal love interest of Gatsby. She is woefully
        unlikable due to her constant whining and entitled personality. She had a brief romantic affair with Gatsby
        before her marriage to Tom while he was in the military. She and Tom live across the Bay from Gatsby denoted by
        a green light that is the subject of millions of high school essays on symbolism.

        The Great Gatsby is best understood from this nickname. It isn't "Great" like Alexander the Great, but "Great"
        like an attraction at a circus. "Step right up, come see The Great Gatsby" is the proper context for his
        epithet. He is a ostentatiously wealthy socialite holding parties that are the talk of the town. He himself
        is enigmatic and aloof inspiring a wealth of rumors and gossip in the elite social scene. Later, it is
        revealed that his wealth stems from bootlegging (scandalous) despite his sobriety and is deeply in love with
        Daisy (or, at least the idea of Daisy). He also served in the same division as Nick leading to a natural
        friendship between the two.
        <br><br>
        Nick is also a product of wealth, his ancestor was able to pay someone to fight in the Civil War on his behalf
        then prudently invest his savings to become rich from the war effort. After graduating Yale and serving in WWI,
        Nick moves to New York for work as a bond-salesman (a lucrative career move). He begins optimistic and
        adventurous but becomes dillusioned by the events of the novel and returns to the midwest.
        <br><br>
        <b>Events of the Novel:</b> Act 1 establishes the scene and introduces the characters outlined above. Act II
        begins at one of Gatsby's parties where we learn Gatsby's identity is largely performative and intended to
        attract Daisy, whom he is effectively addicted. Through his friendship with Nick, Gatsby coordinates a meeting
        with Daisy with Nick as a serious Third-Wheel but the meeting kicks off an affair between Daisy and Gatsy
        regardless.
        <br><br>

        The story takes a turn when Tom deduces the affair between Daisy and Gatsby. Despite being a serial adulterer,
        he is outraged. Gatsby defends his love for her but Tom is unmoved and calls Gatsby out for bootlegging and
        Daisy resolves to stay with Tom - likely due to her lack of spine and self-authenticity.
        <br><br>
        The climax/twist of the detective/murder style novel is a fatal crash between Gatsby's car and Myrtle, Tom's
        mistress. Nick later learns that Daisy was driving the car, not Gatsby (as was initially claimed). Tom tells
        George, Myrtle's husband, that Gatsby drove the car and is Myrtle's secret lover (who, in reality, is Tom)
        prompting him to kill Gatsby and himself. Nick attends Gatsby's funeral only to find it poorly attended even
        though his parties were so popular. Nick then moves back to the midwest.
        <br><br>
        <b>Analysis:</b> The dominant lesson derived from The Great Gatsby is in the context of early 20th century
        America and it's ability to disabuse the reader of nationalistic mythologies about The American Dream. The
        characters have all you can ask for in the roarin' twenties of industrialized America - wealth, cars, mansions,
        parties, and beautiful women.
        <br><br>
        Gatsby creates a fake persona in accordance with society's standards even though he deeply longs for a
        different life with him and Daisy. A life more "spiritual" or at least less material. Similarly, Tom
        puts on a show for his marriage while cheating on Myrtle habitually. Nick's disillusionment with their
        supposedly "ideal" lifestyle that embodies the American Dream is completed by the murder-suicide at the end
        of the novel.
        <br><br>
        To respond to the English Soccer teammate, the "high school" interpretation that connects The Great Gatsby to
        the American dream can be advanced through superior generalization. It's not just the American Dream that is
        getting called out in The Great Gatsy, it's the juvenile desire of social acceptance stemming from
        external validation. Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom have all "become Great" by society's standards but not their own.
        They forgot to develop themselves into the type of person who <em>deserves</em> great love, wealth, and
        popularity. They live a charade of a life with tortured internal souls that ultimately lead to their demise.
        <br><br>
        The lesson is timeless, and makes the book much more significant than a period piece about runaway capitalism.
        Take The Great Gatsby as a cautionary tale against superficial facades that don't address foundational drives
        for meaning and significance. Don't be like Tom, Daisy, or Gatsby. The characters are unlikeable of a reason,
        to deter you from them.
